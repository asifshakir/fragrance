He concocts that Abu Talib (peace be upon him) hesitated to embrace Islam upon the Prophet&#8217;s insistence, prompting the revelation of Quranic verse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"ar\">\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0644\u0650\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0650\u0651 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0622\u0645\u064e\u0646\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u0646 \u064a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u063a\u0652\u0641\u0650\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0644\u0650\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0634\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0643\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0648\u0652 \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0623\u064f\u0648\u0644\u0650\u064a \u0642\u064f\u0631\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0645\u0650\u0646 \u0628\u064e\u0639\u0652\u062f\u0650 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0628\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0646\u064e \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0635\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062c\u064e\u062d\u0650\u064a\u0645\u0650<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not (fit) for the Prophet and those who believe that they should ask forgiveness for the polytheists, even though they should be near relatives after it has become clear to them that they are inmates of the flaming fire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reference: Surah Tawbah (9) verse 119<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen Abu Talib&#8217;s death approached, the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) went to him while Abu Jahl and `Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya were present with him. The Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) said, &#8220;O uncle, say: None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, so that I may argue for your case with it before Allah.&#8221; On that, Abu Jahl and `Abdullah bin Abu Umaiya said, &#8220;O Abu Talib! Do you want to renounce `Abdul Muttalib&#8217;s religion?&#8221; Then the Prophet said, &#8220;I will keep on asking (Allah for) forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden to do so.&#8221; Then there was revealed: <strong><em>&#8216;It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe that they should invoke (Allah) for forgiveness for pagans even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of the Fire.&#8217;\u201d (Surah Tawbah (9) verse 113)<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reference: Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 65, Hadith 197<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this linkage poses a significant historical challenge. Surah At-Tawbah was revealed in Medina in 9 A.H., whereas Hazrat Abu Talib (peace be upon him) passed away in Mecca several years earlier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Bukhari acknowledges the Madani origin of Surah At-Tawbah in his Sahih Bukhari, book 65, Hadith 127 completely debunking the narrative&#8217;s veracity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This discrepancy illuminates Bukhari&#8217;s apparent bias against Abu Talib (peace be upon him) and his family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite Bukhari&#8217;s extensive collection of traditions from over 2400 narrators, it consists of narrators like Imran ibn Hattan, who used to recite poems praising the Khawarij. Bukhari dares to narrate traditions from the Killers of Imam Hussain (peace be upon him), fabricators, liars, and people who were unreliable but did not deem it appropriate to narrate even a single tradition from Imam Sadiq (peace be upon him) in his book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, Bukhari includes narrations from questionable sources and prejudiced narratives that undermine the legacy of Hazrat Abu Talib (peace be upon him) and his descendants, raising serious concerns about the integrity of his work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, the claim that Surah At-Tawbah links to Abu Talib (peace be upon him) is false. This fabricated connection implies he hesitated to accept Islam, which contradicts the timing of the Surah&#8217;s revelation after his death. Moreover, the bias displayed by Bukhari against Hazrat Abu Talib (peace be upon him) and his family raises serious concerns about the authenticity of his work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scholars and believers must diligently scrutinize historical narratives to uphold and preserve the true legacy of figures like Hazrat Abu Talib (peace be upon him).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Numerous narrations from the Ahlul Bayt (peace be upon them) extol the virtues of Hazrat Abu Talib (peace be upon him) and emphasize his importance on the Day of Judgment.

For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/thestrongrope.com\/dhahabis-malice-against-imam-ali-a-s\/\">Dhahabi has criticized Nisaai, who is the author of one of the four most popular books of the Ahle Tasannun for his love of Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him)<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why do some from the Ahle Tasannun claim that Hazrat Abu Talib (peace be upon him) was not a believer? The answer is as clear as daylight.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are numerous reasons for this false allegation, primarily stemming from jealousy and hatred towards Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him). From the inception of Islam. Imam Ali (peace be upon him) was consistently the first to respond and assist the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) in every task, which did not go unnoticed by the hypocrites who held grudges against him since the day of Dawat-e-Zul Asheera. For example: <a href=\"https:\/\/thestrongrope.com\/proofs-of-the-undesirable-actions-of-the-ahle-tasannun-scholars-in-hiding-the-caliphate-of-ameerul-momineen-a-s\/\">Tabari tried to change his record of Dawat-e-Zul Asheera to hide the excellences of Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) killed many hypocrites in battlefields, further aggravating their animosity. These hypocrites, who never wanted Islam to flourish, saw their plans thwarted by the relentless efforts of the Ahlul Bayt (peace be upon them). Following the martyrdom of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny), these hypocrites rebelled, oppressing the Ahlul Bayt (peace be upon them) through false allegations, defamation, social boycotts, and killings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One significant reason for the baseless claims about Hazrat Abu Talib\u2019s (peace be upon him) faith is his relationship with Imam Ali (peace be upon him) and his lifelong service to the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) and Islam. To the extent that Bukhari despite his extreme bias against the Ahlul Bait (peace be upon them) has recorded a tradition from Abbas (the uncle of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny)) that speaks about the sacrifices of Hazrat Abu Talib (peace be upon him) for the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) \u2013 Refer: <a href=\"https:\/\/sunnah.com\/bukhari:6208\">Bukhari Tradition No: 6208<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, they even raised false allegations on the faith of Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him), despite acknowledging him as one of the four rightly guided caliphs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As documented by Shaikh al-Saduq (ar) in Elal al-Sharaye, \u201cAli ibn Hathram said: I was in the assembly of Ahmad ibn Hanbal when the mention of Ali ibn Abi Talib, peace be upon him, came up, and he said: &#8220;A man cannot be a Sunni until he dislikes Ali (peace be upon him) a little\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reference: Elal al-Sharaye, volume 2, page 468, tradition no. 65<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ibn Abi al-Hadid, the famed Motazali scholar has discussed this in his book &#8220;Sharh Nahjul Balaghah,&#8221; wherein he has brought an entire chapter titled &#8220;Al Hadeesul Mauzuato Fi Zammi Ali&#8217; in (A.S.)&#8221; which translates to &#8220;The Fabricated Traditions in Condemnation of Amirul Momineen Ali ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon them both).&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One such narration from Zohri goes like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnd Abd al-Razzaq narrated from Ma&#8217;mar that al-Zohri had two narrations from Urwah about Aisha regarding Ali (peace be upon him), so he asked him about them one day. He said: \u201cWhat do you want to do with them? God knows best about them. I indeed accuse them (Urwah and Aisha) of bias towards the Bani Hashim.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;As for the first hadith, we have mentioned it. As for the second hadith, it is that Urwah claimed that Aisha narrated to him that she said: &#8216;I was with the Prophet when al-Abbas and Ali (peace be upon him) came in. He said: &#8216;O Aisha, if you wish to look at two men of the Hellfire, then look at these two who have just entered.&#8217; So, I looked, and it was al-Abbas and Ali ibn Abi Talib!!&#8217; [God forbid]&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reference: Sharh Nahjul Balagah, Ibn Abil Hadeed, vol 4 page 64<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another narration about Hazrat Abu Talib (peace be upon him) is quoted by Amr ibn Aas, an advisor to Muawiya.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnd a hadith is narrated from him that is narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim in their Sahihs with a connected chain of transmission to Amr ibn al-Aas, who said: &#8220;I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) say: &#8216;The progeny of Abu so-and-so (referring to Hazrat Abu Talib (peace be upon him)) are not my guardians; rather, my guardians are Allah and the righteous believers.'&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reference: Sharh Nahjul Balagah, Ibn Abil Hadeed, vol 4 page 64, Bukhari tradition no. 5990, Muslim, tradition no. 215<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These traditions clearly showcase the hatred towards the Ahlul Bayt (peace be upon them), particularly Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) and his father, Hazrat Abu Talib (peace be upon him).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is worth questioning whether such allegations would be directed towards their self-appointed caliphs. In reality, their own caliphs committed numerous oppressions and frequently transgressed religious boundaries. To obscure their faults, they attempt to defame Hazrat Abu Talib (peace be upon him) and his immaculate progeny (peace be upon them).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By closely examining these narratives through Quranic verses and the teachings of Ahlul Bayt (peace be upon them), we find numerous narrations that speak about the pure belief and righteousness of Hazrat Abu Talib (peace be upon him).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is crucial to approach these historical accounts with a discerning eye and an open heart to uncover the true legacy of this esteemed figure in Islamic history. May Allah grant us the intercession of this great personality of Islam.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Upon reviewing texts regarding Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him), it becomes evident that those living alongside him have often been a victim of bias.

asked The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny):<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) said: &#8216;Ah, ah! You have asked me about the best child born after me according to the Sunnah of the Maseeh (peace be upon him).&#8217; Truly, Allah, the Blessed, and Exalted, created me and Ali (peace be upon him) from one light \u2014 before He created the creation by five hundred thousand years. We were glorifying and sanctifying Allah, and when Allah, the Exalted, created Adam (peace be upon him), He cast us into his back, and I settled on his right side and Ali (peace be upon him) on his left.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then He transferred us from his back into the pure loins and the good wombs, we continued in this way until Allah, the Blessed, and Exalted, caused me to emerge from a pure back, which was that of Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib (peace be upon him) and he entrusted me to the best womb, which is Aamina (peace be upon her). Then Allah, the Blessed and Almighty, caused Ali to emerge from a pure back and that is Abu Talib (peace be upon him) and He entrusted him to the best womb, which is Fatima bin Asad (peace be upon her).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then he said, O Jabir, before Ali (peace be upon him) entered his mother&#8217;s womb, there was a worshipper, a monk in his time whose name was Masram ibn Daeeb Al Shaywatam. He was mentioned among the worshippers as having worshipped Allah for 190 years and did not ask Him for any need. He asked his Lord to show him a Wali of His, so Allah, Blessed, and Almighty, sent Abu Talib (peace be upon him) to him.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ref: Behaar al-Anwaar, vol. 35, p. 10<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A monk, who worshipped Allah for 190 years and prayed to meet His divine representative (Wali), was given the honour by Allah of meeting Hazrat Abu Talib (peace be upon him). This signifies the high status of Hazrat Abu Talib (peace be upon him) in the eyes of Allah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another important point that comes out from the incident is that Hazrat Abu Talib (peace be upon him) knew the unseen (Ilmul-Ghaib).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, this incident also tells us that the forefathers of Ahle Bayt (peace be upon them all) like Hazrat Abu Talib, Abdullah, and Abul Muttalib (peace be upon them all) are indeed, among the Auliya Allah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hazrat Abu Talib (peace be upon him) in Holy Quran<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allah, the Almighty reveals in Surah Zuha \u2014 the 93rd chapter of the Holy Quran \u2014 how he provided shelter to the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) at a very young age.

In The above verse, Allah points towards Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) as He was famous as \u2018Yateem-e-Abdullah\u2019, but Allah did not leave him alone and points that we sheltered you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This verse, among others, is proof that Hazrat Abu Talib (peace be upon him) has found a mention in the Holy Quran in a positive sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, the life and legacy of Hazrat Abu Talib (peace be upon him) are characterised by his unwavering faith, his pivotal role in supporting the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy progeny), and his esteemed status in Islam. Despite facing numerous challenges and hardships, Hazrat Abu Talib (peace be upon him) remained steadfast in his commitment to Allah and his support for the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, Hazrat Abu Talib (peace be upon him) stands as a shining example of faith, courage, and devotion in the annals of Islamic history.

Even the Prophets (a.s.) cannot gain her true recognition. This great being can be comprehended in its entirety only by Allah.<\/p>\n<p>In this regard, let us look at the Holy Prophets&#8217; (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) narration:<\/p>\n<p><em style=\"font-weight: inherit;\">When the representatives of Allah will settle in rows (during the Day of Judgement) at that moment Adam (peace be upon him) and other prophets (peace be upon them) will come for your visitation.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>(Behaar al-Anwaar, vol. 43 p. 22)<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, what an eminent position it is for all the Prophets (peace be upon them) to stand in rows and call on Hazrat Fatemah Zahra (peace be upon her). The human mind fails to grasp the prominence Allah has conferred upon this great lady.<\/p>\n<p>Surely, none can perceive the greatness of the lady who will have Prophets (peace be upon them) lining up to call on her in paradise. As it is the minds fail to fathom the status of Prophets (peace be upon them), so how is it possible to realize the position of one who will be visited by rows of Prophets (peace be upon them)?<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-style: inherit;\">Creation of Hazrat Zahra (peace be upon her)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The following narration has been reported by both the Shias and Bakris. It is so authentic from the reliability point of view that a fatwa can be delivered on its basis.<\/p>\n<p>Imam Jafar al-Sadiq (peace be upon him) informs: The noble Messenger (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) would kiss Hazrat Zahra (peace be upon her) a lot. When Ayesha objected saying: O Messenger of Allah, what is the reason behind you kissing Fatemah so much?<\/p>\n<p>The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) replied:<\/p>\n<p><em style=\"font-weight: inherit;\">When I ascended to the heavens (Meraaj), I visited paradise. From the tress of paradise, I saw a tree that was better than all the other trees. There was no tree whiter or more fragrant than this one. I took one fruit from this tree. This fruit took the shape of a fluid in my loin and when I returned to earth I transferred what was given to me in trust into Khadija&#8217;s womb from which Fatemah was formed. Therefore, whenever I am desirous of smelling paradise, I smell Fatemah<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>(Behaar al-Anwaar, vol 18 p. 315; Al-Durr al-Mansoor vol 4 p. 153; Al Mojam al Kabeer vol 22 p. 401; Tafseer Noor al-Saqalain, vol 3, p. 98)<\/p>\n<p>It is worth noting that Hazrat Muhammad Mustafa (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) is the most excellent and the most honorable among all the prophets, messengers, and obviously, the entire creation. The purest of places is paradise and from this paradise the most special tree and from this exclusive tree the best fruit. From here begins the pure existence of Hazrat Fatemah Zahra (peace be upon her) and this creation is physical creation. Meaning, the thing from which Hazrat Zahra&#8217;s (peace be upon her) body was formed was from the most beautiful of fruits.<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-style: inherit;\"><u>Relation of the body with the soul<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>From the Quranic point of view, the body and soul have one relation. On the creation of Hazrat Adam (peace be upon him), the Holy Quran says:<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-style: inherit;\">So when I have made him complete and breathed into him of My Spirit\u2026<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>(Surah Hijr (15): Verse 29)<\/p>\n<p>In another place it is mentioned:<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-style: inherit;\">Certainly, We created man in the best form<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>(Surah Teen (95): Verse 4)<\/p>\n<p>No creation is better than humans. Man&#8217;s remarkable features and the form of his body are suitable and worthy for a soul to be breathed into it. Thus, the soul is only infused when the body is deserving of it. This means that all bodies of the world are not worthy enough for life to be breathed into it. When all bodies cannot possess a regular soul; a body other than the regular one is required for someone with the special beneficence of Allah<\/p>\n<p>The body made of worldly material is deserving of a soul to be infused into it and that too a soul which is connected to Allah. For which, Allah says,\u00a0<strong style=\"font-style: inherit;\">It&#8217;s His Spirit<\/strong>. So, for that sacred body, which was formed after eating a fruit from heaven, what kind of soul would be required for it? When this sacred body is different from all bodies of the world, the soul in it, too, will be different from others.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, on this basis, the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) informs: <em style=\"font-weight: inherit;\">The Almighty Allah created her from His resplendent light. When this light dazzled the entire universe was lit up. The eyes of the angels were bedazzled; they fell down in prostration to Allah. They said, &#8220;O Lord! What is this light? Allah sent a revelation: This light is from My Light. I have given it space in My Heavens. I have created this from My Grandeur. Through My Prophets, I will make it appear in the loin of a Prophet, who will be superior to all the other Prophets. Then, from this light, I will create My Imams, who will arise on My command and will guide people towards My rights. After the culmination of revelations, I will appoint them as My vicegerents of earth.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>(Behaar al-Anwaar vol 43 p. 12)<\/p>\n<p>This is how the pure body of Hazrat Fatemah Zahra (peace be upon her) was created with the best fruit from Paradise and Allah created her soul from His resplendent light.

The following incident is noteworthy:<\/p>\n<p>When the usurpers of the caliphate (which was the right of Ameerul Momineen Ali b. Abi Talib (peace be upon him)) arrived at his house and demanded that he step out, Imam Ali (peace be upon him) initially wanted to address them. But Hazrat Fatemah Zahra (peace be upon her) stopped him and she herself attended the door. This was when Umar had come to forcefully take allegiance to Abu Bakr. When Ali (a.s.) did not step out as expected, Umar exclaimed, I swear by the One who has my life in His hand, if you do not submit him (Imam Ali (peace be upon him)) to us, I will burn down the house along with its inmates.<\/p>\n<p>At this threat, his own companions alerted him, O Abu Hafs (i.e. Umar) Fatemah is inside the house.<\/p>\n<p>Umar said indifferently, So what!<\/p>\n<p>(Al-Imamah wa Al-Siyasah vol 1 p. 19)<\/p>\n<p>Reacting to this, Hazrat Fatemah (peace be upon her) said, I haven\u2019t seen more shameless and ill-mannered people than you. You have abandoned the sacred body of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) and gathered over here to usurp our rights!<\/p>\n<p>(Al-Imamah wa Al-Siyasah vol 1 p. 19)<\/p>\n<p>These are those who grew under the tutelage of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) and their status was rooted in the companionship of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). They were recognized in society as Holy Prophets (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) companions. Despite this, they abandoned his (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) revered corpse and rushed to decide the matter of caliphate lest it eludes them. Not content with bagging the caliphate, they set fire to the house of the Prophet&#8217;s (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) beloved daughter, the Chief of all women of Paradise, whose excellence was repeatedly highlighted by the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny).<\/p>\n<p>It is amazing how the companions had changed so dramatically in two to three days. These were the same companions who congregated behind the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) in his mosque for prayers and heard his sermons with rapt attention. After the Prophets (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) demise, it was as if they were never his companions, with the cold-heartedness they displayed towards the Prophets (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) brother and daughter.<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-style: inherit;\"><u>The Calamities befalling Hazrat Fatemah Zahra (peace be upon her)<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Saeed b.

Some Muslims are of the view that we shouldn\u2019t narrate such incidents as whatever has transpired has transpired and there is no benefit in recounting these issues now. By the same logic, half the Quran should be abandoned because it is a mere narration of incidents that have transpired with no benefit for Muslims at present.<\/p>\n<p>It is necessary not only to narrate incidents revolving around the Prophet&#8217;s (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) rightful successor but also to investigate those who prevented the truth from prevailing and misled the masses. This is necessary so that we pursue goodness and refrain from evil. This is also one of the reasons for repeated narrations in the Holy Quran of the past prophets and their nations.<\/p>\n<p>Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) foresaw this incident when he informed, <em style=\"font-weight: inherit;\">As if I am present at that time and witnessing how lowly and despicable characters are entering this house (of Hazrat Zahra (peace be upon her)).<\/em><\/p>\n<p>What can be more offensive than the fact that ill-mannered people are at the door wanting to set the house on fire? Can there be anything more offensive and infuriating for Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) than to watch his wife being felled by the door and being fatally wounded so much so that her ribs were left fractured, eventually departing from this world due to the injury?<\/p>\n<p>The following incident is notable:<\/p>\n<p>Ibn Abi al-Hadid al-Motazali\u201d a famous Sunni scholar writes, One day I recounted the incident of the conquest of Makkah and Habbar ibn Aswad in front of my teacher Abu Jafar Naqeet. Following the conquest of Makkah, the Messenger (peace be upon him and his holy progeny), despite being a mercy for the worlds, had declared the killing of certain people as permissible. One among them was Habbar b. Aswad. The cause for this was traced to the migration of Muslims to Madinah. When the ladies from Prophets (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) family were migrating to Madinah from Makkah, among them was the Prophets (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) foster daughter Zainab. Habbar had cast a spear toward her which killed her child. In Holy Prophets (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) view the crime was so gruesome that he had made the blood of Habbar b. Aswad permissible.<\/p>\n<p>Ibn Abi al-Hadid recounts: My teacher Abu Jafar Naqeet said, If the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) were alive then wouldn\u2019t he have declared as permissible the blood of those who had terrorized and threatened Hazrat Fatemah Zahra (peace be upon her) which eventually claimed the life of her unborn child Mohsin?<\/p>\n<p>(Sharh-o-Nahj al-Balaaghah of Ibn Abi \u00c2\u00a0al-Hadid, vol. 3 p. 35)<\/p>\n<p>Now, take a look at the statement of Shams al-Deen al-Zahabi (exp. 748 A.H.), a reliable Sunni scholar, recorded in his book Mizaan al-Etedaal Umar pushed Fatemah with so much force that it resulted in Mohsins death.<\/p>\n<p>(Mizaan al-Etedaal vol. 1 p. 139)<\/p>\n<p>Abu Baseer (r.a.) relates \u201d I asked Imam Jafar Sadiq (peace be upon him): Why did Hazrat Fatemah Zahra (peace be upon her) depart from this world at such a young age?<\/p>\n<p>He (peace be upon him) replied:\u00a0<em style=\"font-weight: inherit;\">She was martyred young because Umars slave, Qunfooz, acting on Umar&#8217;s orders, attacked Hazrat Zahra (peace be upon her) so harshly with the sheath of his sword that Mohsin was killed.

Muawiyah Ibn Mugheerah Ibn Abil Aas, the one who desecrated Hamza\u2019s corpse was given three days to vacate Medina. Retaliation against Wahshi should have been natural for the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) who was terribly upset at seeing the mutilated corpse of his beloved uncle, but he chose patience after Allah revealed the verse at that stage:<br \/>\n<em>And if you take your turn, then retaliate with the like of that with which you were afflicted; but if you are patient, it will certainly be best for those who are patient.<\/em>(Surah Nahl (16): 126)<\/li>\n<li>Khalid Ibn Walid wiped out an entire tribe (Bani Jazimah) of newly converted Muslims due to an old rivalry dating to the pre-Islamic period. The Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) showed his anger by repeatedly dissociating himself from Khalid\u2019s action without punishing Khalid. Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) settled the matter with blood money by sending Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him). (Sahih Bukhari book 64, trad 368)<\/li>\n<li>In the incident of Aqabah, the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) faced a deadly attack from over a dozen hypocrites. Not only did the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) let them get away, but he did not even publicly name them \u2013 he (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) identified the attackers only to Huzaifa and even then, warned him from revealing their identities. This was to prevent problems in Islamic society at a later stage. When the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) was told to name the hypocrites and punish them, he (peace be upon him and his holy progeny): <em>I don\u2019t like people to say \u2013 first Muhammad places his hand in the hands of companions, then names them as conspirators. (<\/em>Majma al-Bayan v 5 p 68 under Tafseer of Surah Tauba (9): 74)So when Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) did not retaliate for an attack on him when he had all the support and the entire Muslim army behind him, it is not surprising if Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) likewise did not retaliate for the attack on Fatima Zahra (peace be upon her) when he (peace be upon him) was alone with no supporters. In fact, non-retaliation was the natural course of action for Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him).<\/li>\n<li>Abu Sufyan, Muawiyah, Amr Aas who for years had tormented the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) were left unpunished even when Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) had the opportunity to punish them.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Likewise, the Ahle Bait (peace be upon them) did not retaliate, rather they overlooked their oppressors on the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) and for the same reasons \u2013 to avoid conflict in religion and for the divine promised of greater reward for patience:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the battle of Jamal, Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) spared Marwan who had been captured and did not even demand that Marwan pay allegiance. He (peace be upon him) also sent Prophet\u2019s wife back to Medina. Rebelling against the caliph of the time was punishable by death, but Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) overlooked it.<\/li>\n<li>Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) did not take back Fadak (which is another objection of the skeptics) because till the time Fatima Zahra (peace be upon her) was deprived of Fadak she was oppressed and was being rewarded and Abu Bakr was an oppressor and was being punished and Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) did not wish to disturb both these sequences.<\/li>\n<li>Even for his own killer Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) laid a rule that he was to be killed with a single stroke if he (peace be upon him) dies, which suggests that had Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) survived the fatal blow, he may have overlooked punishing Abdul Rahman. Also, he (peace be upon him) stressed Abdul Rahman\u2019s body was not to be mutilated.<\/li>\n<li>Imam Husain (peace be upon him) did not retaliate against Ayesha and Marwan for attacking the bier of Imam Hasan (peace be upon him) with arrows.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>All these examples show that non-retaliation was the norm for Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) and Ahle Bait (peace be upon them) and just because there was no retaliation for Fatima Zahra (peace be upon her) killing it does not mean there was no attack.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The skeptic\u2019s intent behind this line of questioning is to deny the attacks.

She being a lady of exalted disposition, enjoyed great spiritual status and this was well-acknowledged by the Islamic world. She had all along remained aloof from the world and was wary of its trappings and deceit. However, after the Prophet\u2019s (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) demise, she agitated against the government to assert her claim over Fadak.<\/p>\n<p>What brought about this change in her outlook to worldly possessions after snubbing them all her life? Why after recognizing the world for what it is \u201cmore worthless than a goat\u2019s sneeze or the bone of a pig in the hand of a leper or lighter than the wing of a fly\u201d, did she embark on a prolonged struggle with the government over a piece of property?<\/p>\n<p>What factors made her bear untold hardships, affliction, and troubles in her crusade against the government? Were a small piece of land and a few date trees worth so much trouble? After all, she was fully aware that all her efforts would eventually be in vain, and the government would not return the land to her. It is natural for conscious readers to raise such questions regarding Hazrat Fatemah Zahra\u2019s (peace be upon her) anguished demand for Fadak.<br \/>\nThe questions are not complex for students of Islamic history, particularly for those who have closely studied the events in the immediate aftermath of the Holy Prophet\u2019s (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) demise. A cursory analysis of these events will provide the readers with the answers they are seeking.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>The first and primary reason<\/em><\/strong> was that Fadak was usurped to deprive Hazrat Fatemah Zahra (peace be upon her) of her lawful property and thus financially weaken the progeny of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) was already facing opposition in his claim for caliphate; by withholding the property of Fadak, an attack was being inflicted by the government to weaken him economically. It was anticipated by the government that the people would see Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) as financially weak and would disregard his claim to the caliphate. In the process, they wanted to dent his social and religious status. This was the very tactic adopted by the hypocrites with regard to the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) in the early era of Islam, who had imposed economic sanctions against all the companions and helpers of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny), thereby aiming to weaken him (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) and his mission.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>The second reason<\/em><\/strong> was that the income of Fadak was substantial. According to Ibn Abil Hadeed al-Mutazali, the number of date trees in Fadak was equal to the total number of date trees in Kufa. Allama Majlisi (r.a.) quotes from \u2018Kashf al-Muhajja\u2019, the annual income of Fadak was 24,000 dinars. Another tradition says that the income was 70,000 dinars.  The disparity in the amounts could be a result of fluctuation in the computation of income over the years. Obviously, such a significant amount did not escape the government\u2019s attention, especially since the Hashimites were the beneficiaries.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>The third reason<\/em><\/strong> was that the demand of Fadak had a direct bearing on the demand of her illustrious husband, Ali Ibn Abi Taalib (peace be upon him) for the caliphate. To substantiate this point, it is worthwhile to delve into an incident involving the renowned scholar Ibn Abil Hadeed al-Mutazali. The latter was studying at Madrasah al-Arabiyyah in Baghdad when he once asked the teacher Ali b. al-Faraqi whether Fatemah (peace be upon her) was truthful.<\/p>\n<p>The teacher answered, \u201cOf course.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThen why did Abu Bakr, who knew she (peace be upon her) was truthful, not return Fadak to her?\u201d shot back the zealous student.<\/p>\n<p>The teacher smiled and responded: \u201cIf Abu Bakr had conceded Fadak to Fatemah (peace be upon her) based on her pleas, she would have claimed that caliphate is the right of my husband which Abu Bakr had usurped. Under the circumstances, Abu Bakr would not have any excuse for denying Ali his right to caliphate (since he had already conceded Fatemah\u2019s (peace be upon her) claim on Fadak). Consequently, he would be bound to accept every argument advanced by her after making this concession.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>The fourth reason<\/em><\/strong> was that right, if not given, should always be demanded. So, the one whose right is usurped is bound to claim his right and struggle for it, since the right is his whether he needs it or is attached to it. The right to claim a usurped property is not related to one\u2019s piety or indifference to the world. One can be pious and aloof from worldly possessions and still claim his usurped right vociferously.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>The fifth reason<\/em><\/strong> is that a man, however aloof he may have remained from worldly possessions, is duty-bound to spend money on religious obligations (like joining relations \u2013 Sila-e-Rahm) and other duties enjoined by Allah the Almighty. Finance is required to perform these obligations and duties, and if that money is usurped by someone, he <strong><em>must<\/em><\/strong> attempt to recover the same to perform his religious duties. Does history not confirm that the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) was the most pious and God-fearing of all Muslims? Even then, to further the cause of Islam, he needed the property and wealth of Hazrat Khadijah (peace be upon her).<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>The sixth reason<\/em><\/strong> is that reason demands that one should struggle to assert his usurped right. This can give rise to one of two scenarios:<\/p>\n<p>a) If his struggle bears fruit, he will get what he wanted. Thus, his objective would be achieved in his struggle.<\/p>\n<p>b)  If he fails in his endeavor and cannot reclaim his right, the usurper would stand fully exposed before all those who are aware of the truth. Every time people see the oppressed man, they will be reminded of the usurper regardless of his good qualities and ethics. In fact, the people will come to realize that these qualities are a fa\u00e7ade under which the usurper oppresses and cheats people.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>The seventh reason<\/em><\/strong> was to invite the attention of the masses toward their oppressed state. Imposters and frauds use money and influence to win the heart of the masses. But the noblemen win over the masses with their sincerity and ethics. When oppressed, such people use wisdom and exhortation to prove their point so that the people can clearly differentiate between the oppressor and the oppressed one and support the latter in his struggle against the former.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, keeping in view the abovementioned factors, there was merit in Hazrat Fatemah Zahra\u2019s (peace be upon her) crusade against the government that made her address the Muslims in <strong><em>Masjid al-Nabavi<\/em><\/strong>, the Mosque of her beloved father (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) in a bid to establish her right.<\/p>\n<p>She (peace be upon her) did not go to the house of the first caliph for discussions. Instead, she selected a place that was the center for discussion and the meeting point for Muslims. She (peace be upon her) also selected the best time to go to the mosque. At that time, the mosque was filled to capacity by the Muhajireen, the Ansaar, and people of various social strata. Moreover, she did not go to the mosque alone; rather she was accompanied by a group of ladies, who surrounded her.<\/p>\n<p>Before her arrival in the mosque, a curtain was suspended at a pre-determined place so that she might address the audience from behind it<\/p>\n<p>These arrangements were made so that she could present her arguments without compromising on etiquette. After all, she was the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) who had proclaimed, \u201c<em>I am the most learned and cultured man in the whole of Arabia.<\/em>\u201d She was a role model for all Muslim women till the Day of Judgment as her father (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) had declared, \u201c<em>An angel informed me and gave me glad tidings that my daughter, Fatemah is the chief of all women of my nation.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hazrat Fatemah Zahra (peace be upon her) (the chief of all women in Paradise) was least interested in worldly possessions.

But, on 28th Safar 11 A.H., the moment the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) was martyred, in Rabi al-Awwal the house of purification was attacked so brutally that the unborn child of Imam Ali (peace be upon him) and Her Eminence Fatima (peace be upon her) was martyred in his mother\u2019s womb by the tyrants. It was the martyrdom of Mohsin Ibn Ali (peace be upon him) which laid the foundation of Karbala. Hence, from 28th Safar till 8th Rabi al-Awwal i.e. till the martyrdom of Imam Hasan Askari (peace be upon him), the lovers of the Ahlul Bait (peace be upon him) observe these 10 days as \u2018Ayyaam-e-Azaa-e-Mohsiniyyah\u2019 so that the world comes to know that those Ahlul Bait whose love was ordained in the Holy Quran, how the Muslim Ummah treated them by defying the Quranic orders. Hence, it is our responsibility that although these 10 days are the last 10 days of the mourning period, however, our grief, weeping, and mourning should never reduce during this time because for us these might be the last days of the mourning period but, for the Ahlul Bait (peace be upon him) this was the beginning of their tragedies.<\/p>\n<p>We pray to Allah to grant us the opportunity to observe these Ayyam-e-Azaa-e-Mohsiniyyah. Who knows whether this would be our last mourning opportunity? Lastly, to avenge the killing of Mohsin (peace be upon him) and the oppressions upon the Ahlul Bait (peace be upon him), hasten the reappearance of the Imam of our time, His Eminence Imam Mahdi (may Allah hasten his noble reappearance).<\/p>\n<p>Aameen, O Lord of the worlds!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mufazzal Ibn Umar narrates in a lengthy tradition from Imam Ja\u2019far Sadiq (peace be upon him) regarding how Mohsin Ibn Ali (peace be upon him) will be brought on the Day of Judgement.

Read a book on Karbala<\/strong><br \/>\nAfter consultations with some learned people, select a book or books on Karbala and read them throughout these days of mourning. This will increase your ma\u2019refat about Imam Husain (peace be upon him) and his companions which will take you nearer to them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4.

Wear black clothes, hoist the alam of Hazrat Abbas (peace be upon him) on your houses, put black bedsheets, curtains and wall displays in your houses and other such things by which it should be known to the world that you are in a state of mourning.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5.

Seek nearness to Allah through Zikr-e-Husain (peace be upon him)<\/strong><br \/>\nZikr-e-Husain (peace be upon him) should be the cause of your nearness to Allah (s.w.t.) i.e., it should lead you to acts of obedience of Allah like prayers, fasting, reciting Holy Quran, dua, helping the poor, etc. and avoid sins as much as possible, like backbiting, lies, not wearing the hijab, etc. Using this opportunity, you must also promise to Imam Husain (peace be upon him) that you will avoid sins as much as possible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>9.

In Sunan Tirmidhi, Hadith 3713, it is mentioned that this tradition of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) in which he said, <em>&#8216;Of Whomsoever I am the master, this Ali is his master&#8217;<\/em> is correct (Sahih). Therefore, none can deny the authenticity of Eid al-Ghadeer. But instead of accepting this hadith and this incident, and instead of following the practice (Sunnah) of Umar Ibn Khattab, the skeptics put forward all sorts of frivolous objections to hide this clear incident from the people and deprived them of its importance. One of their unwarranted objections is that in this tradition, the word \u2018Maula\u2019 means &#8216;friend&#8217; and not a master, a guardian, and one who has authority over people&#8217;s lives and property like the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). They should keep in mind that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>This announcement was made by the Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) during his last Hajj and hence it has its own individual status and importance<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>This announcement was done amidst 125,000 Hajj pilgrims and was witnessed by great companions<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If the word &#8216;Maula&#8217; means friend, then was it the practice (Sunnah) of the companions that everyone should be congratulated in a gathering for friendship?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>God forbid, was Imam Ali (peace be upon him) an enemy to anyone prior to this that his friendship was being declared?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If anyone, due to prejudice or ignorance, believes that the word &#8216;Maula&#8217; means friend, then was it the practice (Sunnah) of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) that the friendship of every companion should be announced in a congregation? If it was, why is there no historical record of such an announcement for the rest of the companions? And if it wasn\u2019t, then there is nothing wrong with removing the veils of negligence and accepting that this announcement was a special one.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We shouldn\u2019t find ourselves in a situation where we become deserving of the punishment for deliberately concealing the event of Ghadeer, as history is witness that the consequences of deliberately hiding this event have been dangerous.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amirah Ibn Sa\u2019d narrates that \u201cI saw Imam Ali (peace be upon him) ascending the pulpit and the companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny), including Abu Sa&#8217;eed, Abu Hurairah, Anas bin Malik, and 12 such people gathered around the pulpit. At that time Imam Ali (peace be upon him) asked all of them, &#8216;I implore you in the name of Allah, did you not hear the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) say: Of whomsoever, I am the master, this Ali is his master?\u2019 They said, &#8216;By Allah, Yes!&#8217; But one companion remained seated and did not bear this witness. Imam Ali (peace be upon him) asked him, \u2018What has prevented you from giving this testimony?\u2019 He replied, \u2018I have become old and I do not remember\u2019. Upon hearing this, Imam Ali (peace be upon him) complained to Allah thus, &#8216;O Allah! If he is telling a lie, then send down upon him a calamity that destroys his beauty!&#8217; A white spot had appeared on his forehead which he was unable to hide even with a turban and it remained there until his death.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Hilyah al-Awliyaa by Hafiz Abu Nu\u2019aim Isfahani, vol. 5, pp. 26-27]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eid al-Ghadeer is an important Islamic Eid. Why should Muslims stay behind in celebrating a day whose importance can be understood from the fact that the Almighty Allah revealed a verse, His Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) announces it and a companion like Umar Ibn Khattab offers congratulations. Will Muslims also ignore the practice (Sunnah) of companions?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, let\u2019s celebrate Eid al-Ghadeer by following the command of God, the command of His Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny), and the practice (Sunnah) of the companions.

According to Ahle Tasannun, this verse is applicable to every ruler and caliph in Islamic history. If we accept this view of the Ahle Tasannun then it would also include Yazid Ibn Muawiyah in this list of rulers and caliphs although a majority of the Muslims consider Yazid and his likes to be accursed. Pondering over this verse, we will realise that the word used therein is \u2018earth\u2019 which obviously refers to the entire world. It cannot be limited to Makkah, Madinah, Hejaz, Iraq, or other Islamic countries currently because these are a part of the earth, not the entire earth. Hence, right from the initial period of Islam till date, history has never witnessed a moment wherein a divine caliph ruled the entire world or Islam being the dominant religion.<\/p>\n<p>2nd Promise: Allah, the Exalted, will establish that religion with which He is satisfied. The famous Ahle Tasannun scholar Ibn Jauzi in his book Zaad al-Maseer, vol. 6, p. 58 narrates that the word \u2018religion\u2019 in this verse refers to Islam and establishing means Islam\u2019s domination and success over all other religions. However, to date, Islam has never been able to dominate over other religions as the only practiced religion. Now, it is the responsibility of every Muslim to know about that religion with which Allah is satisfied because our eternal fortune is dependent on that very religion with which Allah is pleased. Keeping emotions aside, every Muslim must think in the light of intellect as to which is Allah\u2019s chosen religion. A religion which was perfected in Ghadeer with the announcement of the Imamate and Mastership of 12 Imams i.e., Imam Ali (peace be upon him) and his 11 successors (peace be upon them). A religion that is certified in the Holy Quran or some other religion that has no relation to Ghadeer?<\/p>\n<p>3rd Promise: Exchange the fear of the believers with security.<\/p>\n<p>4th Promise: Only Allah will be worshipped on earth and there will be no trace of polytheism.<\/p>\n<p>At present, the vast majority of polytheists and disbelievers, through widespread injustice and tyranny, have created an environment of fear and anxiety. It means that every Muslim will vouch for the fact that all the promises made by Allah in this verse are yet to be fulfilled. But, being a Muslim, it is our firm belief that each of these divine promises shall definitely be fulfilled. But this is possible at the hands of only one man, the last successor of Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) i.e. His Eminence Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.).<\/p>\n<p>Hence, we earnestly pray to the Almighty Allah, that in order to spread the religion of Islam in this entire world and establish peace and harmony, hasten the reappearance of His last proof and true caliph, His Eminence Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.), and keep us steadfast on the belief in his Mastership.<\/p>\n<p>Aameen, O Lord of the worlds!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Allah, Mighty and Majestic be He, says in Surah Noor (24): Verse 55 of the Holy Quran Allah has promised to those of you who believe and do good that He will most certainly make them rulers in the earth as He made rulers those before them, and that He will most certainly establish for&#8230;

Lady Fatema bint Asad (peace be upon her) emerged three days after the delivery of the newborn and handed over the infant in the eagerly waiting arms of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). The child opened his eyes to gaze at the radiant visage of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny).<\/p>\n<p>The sacred stature of the Holy Kaaba is indisputably evident in the Islamic world. Muslims desire to visit the Holy House of Allah at least once in their lifetime. The glorious cube-like structure was constructed at the divine command by the revered chosen apostles of Allah (peace be upon them). For the Islamic world, Holy Kaaba symbolizes profound love and affection in their hearts. Allah enhanced the attachment of Muslims towards His house by facilitating the birth of Ameerul Momineen, Imam Ali (peace be upon him), His chosen friend and successor to the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) by tearing the walls of His house asunder. Thus, highlighting the unique relationship between Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) and the Holy Kaaba.<\/p>\n<p>We shall now analyze and describe the distinctive parallel between the stature of Holy Kaaba and the sublime status of Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him).<\/p>\n<p>The birth of Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) in Holy Kaaba has no precedent.<\/p>\n<p>As a matter of consensus, Muslim sects are unanimous that Ameerul Momineen, Imam Ali Ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon them both) had been the only one to have been born inside Kaaba. Neither before him nor after him, was any child given birth in the four walls of the sacred edifice.<\/p>\n<p>Renown Ahle Tasannun scholar, who hails from Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Shaikh Momin ibn Hasan Momin Shablanjihas recorded in his book Noor al-Absaar Fee Manaqeb Aal Nabi al-Mukhtar (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) on page 154 right at the beginning of the biography of Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him).<\/p>\n<div class=\"ar\">\n\u0644\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u064a\u064f\u0648\u0652\u0644\u064e\u062f\u0652 \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062a\u0650 \u0623\u064e\u062d\u064e\u062f\u064c \u0642\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0647\u0657 \u0633\u0650\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0647\u064f\n<\/div>\n<p>No child was born in the House (of Allah) before him<\/p>\n<p>2) Ameerul Momineen, Imam Ali (peace be upon him) is singularly similar to that of Holy Kaaba.<\/p>\n<p>The other fascinating aspect of the persona of Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) is that he was not just born in Holy Kaaba but for all intent and purposes he was also likened to the sacred House in its stature and reverence.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026The example of Ali (peace be upon him) among you is like the Holy Kaaba. Which is enveloped with a cover, looking at it is worship and visiting it for Hajj is mandatory.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The likeness of Ameerul Momineen, Imam Ali (as) to Kaaba is a topic that was extensively reported by scholars in their various books and there is no difference of opinion on the factuality of the concept. Stalwarts among Muslim scholars have recorded scores of traditions with a slight difference in the text but essentially with the same crux of the matter.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few names of the highly reputed and renowned Ahle Tasannun scholars who recorded this tradition in their authoritative research works. This includes Ibne Asakir in his magnum opus Tarikh Damishq vol 42, pg 356 has quoted the tradition verbatim, while Ibne Maghazili in his book Manaqeb Ameeril Momineen Ali Ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon them both) vol 1, pg 164 has reproduced it with slight variation. Nevertheless, Abu Shuja Dailami in his Al-Firdous Be Mathoor al-Khetaab in vol 5 pg 315.\u00a0 Hamavi Shafei in Ghaayat al-Maaram vol 1 and pg 72. Hisaamud Deen Hanafi has recorded in Aal Mohammad vol 1 pg 624 and Ibn Athir in his book Usd al-Ghabah fee Marefat al-Sahaba vol 4, pg 102<\/p>\n<p>3) The Remembrance of Imam Ali (as) is worship:<\/p>\n<p>The merits and excellences of Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) recorded in books are simply inexhaustive. Even staunch scholars of the Ahle Tasannun, cannot shy away from including those exquisite narrations regarding Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) and his magnificent position. Ayesha, a diehard detractor of Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) quoted the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) that<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRemembrance of Ali is an act of worship.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The narration has found its place in several tomes of Ahle Tasannun scholars including Ibne Asakir in Tarikh Damishq vol 42, pg 356, Muttaqi Hindi in Kanzul Ummal fi Sunanul Aqwal wal Afaal vol 11, pg 601, Shaikh Suleman Qundoozi in his celebrated work Yanabi al-Mawaddah le Dhawi al-Qurba vol 2 pg 76.<\/p>\n<p>Gazing at Holy Kaaba is a virtuous act and similarly remembering Ameerul Momineen, Imam Ali (peace be upon him) is an act of worship and has amazing rewards. If looking at Kaaba refreshes heart, discussing the excellence of Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) rejuvenates faith.<\/p>\n<p>Just to summarize our discussion briefly as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The excellences of Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) are supremely exclusive and none has reached even close to it, for instance his exceptional birth in the sanctum sanctorum of Holy Kaaba.<\/li>\n<li>Ameerul Momineen, Imam Ali (peace be upon him) enjoys a unique position of reverence equivalent to that of Holy Kaaba which none of the companions of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) can be ascribed with. Consequently, the respect of Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) becomes obligatory on every Muslim as is the veneration of Holy Kaaba.<\/li>\n<li>Superseding Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) by someone else is like giving preference to some other structure over the Holy Kaaba.<\/li>\n<li>The Holy Kaaba being a vortex of worship, the believers throng the sacred House of Allah. The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) has emphasized on his nation that the Holy Kaaba will not go to people rather people should visit the Holy Kaaba. Nevertheless, and without any ambiguity, the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) has proclaimed that Muslims should swear allegiance to Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) and submit to his mastership by approaching him and not expecting him to seek allegiance by going to their doorsteps. It is delusional to hope that we can perform Hajj in our homes, that the Holy Kaaba will come to our house. Similarly having such fallacious thoughts of Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) seeking their loyalty by going to them are clearly erroneous.<\/li>\n<li>Just as people look at the Holy Kaaba and seek its benefits in this world and in the hereafter, so also Ameerul Momineen, Imam Ali (peace be upon him) is the source of success in this world and in the hereafter.<\/li>\n<li>Opposition or hostility to Ameerul Momineen, Imam Ali (peace be upon him) is like desecration of the Kaaba and whoever does so will be at a loss in the hereafter and will be liable for punishment. Only he can dare to detract with Ameerul Momineen, Imam Ali (peace be upon him) who does not have the love of the House of Allah in his heart.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Today, the focal point of the Muslim nations is to face the Holy Kaaba as their Qibla and Muslims are united in this act of righteousness. Not just for prayers but for every religious act Muslims turn towards Holy Kaaba. It is an important moment for Muslims to deliberate and unite under the guardianship and leadership of their spiritual and real Kaaba, Ameerul Momineen, Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon them both) and the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) and thus express their obedience to God Almighty completely.<\/p>\n<p>Our heartfelt congratulations to all the devotees of Ameerul Momineen, Imam Ali (peace be upon him) on this joyous occasion.

She is a part of me, the light of my eyes and the coolness of my heart. She is my soul which is in my body. Rather, she is a human Hourie. When she stands in her prayer niche, in front of her Lord, Mighty be His Majesty, her light shines for the angels in the sky just as the stars shine for the people on the earth. Then Allah, Mighty and Majestic be He, addresses His angels, \u2018O My Angels! Look at My maid Fatima, the chief of all My maids. When she stands in front of Me, she trembles in My fear and she has turned towards My worship with the bottom of her heart. I make you all as witnesses that I will most surely grant amnesty to her followers (Shias) from the Hell-fire.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Then Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) informed about the atrocities upon his daughter thus:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhenever I look at her, then I am reminded of all that will befall her. As if I can see wretchedness entering her house, she will be disrespected, her rights will be usurped, she will be deprived of her inheritance, her ribs will be broken and she will suffer a miscarriage. She will call out \u2018O Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)!\u2019 But none will reply to her. She will raise a cry for help but no one will come to her aid. She will then always remain grief-stricken, troubled, lamenting. Sometimes she will be reminded of the discontinuation of Divine Revelation from her house. At other times she will miss me. At night, she will feel lonely because now she will not be able to listen to my voice which she could when I used to get up at night for prayers and recite the Holy Quran in it. And now she will find herself in a state that she is not respected anymore whereas earlier she was respected at the time of her father. At that time, Allah, Exalted be His Remembrance, will console her along with the angels just like He consoled Maryam Bint Imraan (s.a.).

When we entered Karbala, Jabir went towards the river Euphrates, performed the ritual bath (Ghusl), wrapped himself in a cloth, and placed a robe upon his shoulders (like the Ehraam of Hajj). Then he opened a purse of a So&#8217;d (a perfume) and applied it upon his body. He then started glorifying Allah at each step until he reached the grave, then he told me, \u2018Tie me to the grave\u2019. So, I tied him to the grave. Then Jabir threw himself on the grave and fell down unconscious. I sprinkled some water upon him. When he regained consciousness, he cried out thrice \u2018O Husain, O Husain, O Husain!\u2019 Then he said,<\/p>\n<p>\u062d\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0628\u064c \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064f\u062c\u0650\u064a\u0628\u064f \u062d\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0628\u064e\u0647\u064f<\/p>\n<p>\u2018A friend is not replying to his friend?\u2019 Then he said,<\/p>\n<p>\u2018How could he reply when the blood of his jugular vein lies smeared upon his throat, while his head has been separated from his body! I bear witness that you are the son of the last of the Prophets (s.a.w.a.), son of the chief of believers and the companion of piety. You are the son of guidance and the fifth among the people of the cloak. You are the son of the leader of all leaders and the son of Fatima, the chief of all women. And why would it not be so, when you have been fed by the hands of the chief of all Messengers (s.a.w.a.) and brought up in the laps of the pious, you were fed with the milk of faith and you grew up along with Islam.

On seeing this, she scolded him and said,<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is disrespect to that clay because by keeping it there, it (Sajdagaah) may get crushed and may break.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>My brother acknowledged that such a thing had already happened twice with him and he promised that he would never keep the clay (Sajdagaah) in his that pocket ever again.<\/p>\n<p>Several days passed after this incident. One night, my respected father, the late Allamah, who was unaware of this incident, saw in a dream that our master Imam Husain (a.s.) had come to meet him and was seated in his library and was treating him with great affection. Then Imam (a.s.) said to my father,<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCall your sons so that I may grant them something.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Then my father called all five of us brothers and we stood in his (a.s.) presence. Imam (a.s.) had some clothes and a few other things. He (a.s.) called each of us one at a time and gave some gifts to us. When it was the turn of that brother of mine, Imam (a.s.) looked at him with displeasure and said to my father,<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis son of yours has broken two Sajdagaah made from the soil of my grave.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After saying this, Imam (a.s.), unlike for my other brothers whom he had called upon, threw something at my brother from afar, which I think was a box for keeping combs.<\/p>\n<p>After this, my father woke up from his dream and narrated it to my mother and she, in turn, narrated that incident to my father. He was amazed at the veracity of the dream.<\/p>\n<p>Dear mourners of Imam Husain (a.s.), the respect of the soil of the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.) is obligatory. Since this is not just the soil of the most superior land but as we found in this incident, Imam Husain (a.s.) is so sensitive about the soil from his grave such that he does not tolerate the slightest of negligence in this matter. Ibn Qulawayh (r.a.) in his book Kaamil al-Ziyaaraat has brought 5 chapters on the topic of the soil of Imam Husain&#8217;s (a.s.) grave in which he has recorded 34 traditions wherein he mentions that the soil is a source of cure and protection, manners of partaking from this soil and the prayers which should be recited before using this soil.<\/p>\n<p>We pray to Allah that He may grant us the good fortune of being careful and respectful towards this soil and that we may train our children to be respectful towards it.

The question that arises here is \u2018What is meant by performing Ziyaarat with recognition (Ma\u2019refah)? The answer to this can be found in other traditions as well as in different statements of various Ziyaaraat themselves. Performing Ziyaarat with recognition means that a visitor should firmly believe that the infallible one whose Ziyaarat he has intended:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>He is Allah\u2019s Proof upon all His creatures. [Al-Kaafi, vol. 4, p. 584]<\/li>\n<li>He is the Allah\u2019s Door through which one can reach Allah. [Al-Kaafi, vol. 4, p. 584]<\/li>\n<li>Whoever opposes him and his family is deviated.

[Al-Kaafi, vol. 4, p. 571]<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>All these rights are found in various traditions and Ziyaaraat statements of the infallible ones (a.s.). It is this recognition with which, if someone visits having certainty in his heart about it, then Allah shall forgive his past and future sins. There is no doubt that this does not refer to sins committed intentionally or purposefully. However, it also does not mean that there is any exaggeration in this tradition.

This land of Karbala will shine among the other gardens of Paradise just like the brightest of all stars in the sky shines for the people of the earth. Its light will bedazzle the people of Paradise and the land of Karbala will call out, \u201cI am the holy, pure and blessed land of Allah to whom the body of the Chief of the Martyrs and the Chief of the youths of Paradise was entrusted.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>[Kaamil al-Ziyaaraat, chapter 88, p. 268, H. 5]<\/p>\n<p>From this tradition of Imam Sajjad (a.s.) it is absolutely clear that no other land can be compared to the holy land of Karbala.

At that time, my aunt Zainab Bint Ali (a.s.) looked at my condition and consoled me thus: \u2018O the remnant of my grandfather, my father, and my brothers! I\u2019m seeing that you are risking your life.\u2019 I replied, \u2018How can I not be restless and not risk my life when I see my master, my uncles, my cousins and my family, their bodies fallen on the ground, drenched in blood, their clothes have been looted, they are neither shrouded nor buried and no one is even going near them\u2026\u2019 Upon hearing this my aunt said, \u2018Do not be disheartened by whatever you see. By Allah, this is a promise of your ancestor Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) to your father, your brother, and your uncle, and certainly Allah took a covenant from some people of this nation whom the Pharaohs of this nation do not recognise but they are well known among the dwellers of the heavens. They will gather these broken bones and bury these bodies and will establish a symbol for the grave of your father, the Chief of Martyrs (a.s.), on the land of Karbala such that its effect will never cease and its symbol will never be eliminated with the passing of nights and days. The Imams of disbelief and the followers of deviation will try their level best to erase and eliminate it but its effect will not cease, rather it will only manifestly increase and its affair will only be elevated.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>[Kaamil al-Ziyaaraat, pp. 261-262; Behaar al-Anwaar, vol. 45, pp. 179-180, H. 30]<\/p>\n<p>Today, the elevated and lofty status of Karbala and the storm of visitors of Imam Husain (a.s.) is the realisation of the prophecy of Lady Zainab (s.a.) on 11th Muharram 61 A.H. to Imam Zain al-Aabideen (a.s.).

But on the other hand, are also those who cannot bear people mourning for Imam Husain (a.s.). They are always on the look-out for attempts to reduce this mourning so that people are kept away from basic human values and instead, adopt brutality and extremism. One such trivial and failed attempt to stop this mourning is that we are told not to cry aloud. As if they are telling us that do not weep loudly so that the remembrance of Imam Husain (a.s.) does not reach others. We do not care about what our opponents accuse us of. For them, it is enough to say that according to the Holy Quran, mourning over Imam Husain (a.s.) is recompense for the efforts of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.). Through it, we offer our condolences to Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) for the martyrdom of his grandson and express our solidarity and loyalty to him. For the Shias, we must know that crying aloud over the martyrdom of Imam Husain (a.s.) is a cause of descent of Divine Mercy.

The narrator says that I saw Imam Sadiq (a.s.) recite in a state of prostration:<\/p>\n<div class=\"ar\">\n\u0648\u064e \u0627\u0631\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u200f \u062a\u0650\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064e\u200f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0639\u0652\u064a\u064f\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u064e\u0651\u062a\u0650\u064a \u062c\u064e\u0631\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u062f\u064f\u0645\u064f\u0648\u0639\u064f\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0631\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0629\u064b \u0644\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627\n<\/div>\n<p>(O Allah) Have mercy on those eyes which shed tears in our affection<\/p>\n<div class=\"ar\">\n\u0648\u064e \u0627\u0631\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u200f \u062a\u0650\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064e\u200f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064f\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0628\u064e \u0627\u0644\u064e\u0651\u062a\u0650\u064a \u062c\u064e\u0632\u0650\u0639\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0648\u064e \u0627\u062d\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0642\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0644\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627\n<\/div>\n<p>Have mercy on those hearts which are aggrieved and restless for us<\/p>\n<div class=\"ar\">\n\u0648\u064e \u0627\u0631\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u064e\u0651\u0631\u0652\u062e\u064e\u0629\u064e \u0627\u0644\u064e\u0651\u062a\u0650\u064a \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0644\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627\n<\/div>\n<p>And have mercy on those raised voices which are for us<\/p>\n<p>[Al-Kaafi, vol. 4, p. 583, H. 11; Kaamil al-Ziyaaraat, p. 117, H. 2; Wasaael al-Shia, vol. 14, p. 412, H. 19482; Behaar al-Anwaar, vol. 98, p. 8, H. 30]<\/p>\n<p>After knowing about this supplication of an infallible Imam in a state of prostration, if anyone prevents from weeping loudly, then it means that person is keeping others away from Divine Mercy.<\/p>\n<p>O Allah!

Eide Ghadeer.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>\u201cOf Whomever I am Master, this Ali is his Master,\u201d thus declared the Holy Prophet (saw)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>The 18th Zilhajj in the 10<sup>th<\/sup> year of Hijri has marked the epoch in Islamic history.<\/p>\n<p>On this bright sunny day, the Holy Prophet (saw)\u00a0 by the command of Almighty Allah, proclaimed in the plains of Ghadeer to an audience of 125000 companions &#8212; a message which perfected Islam.<\/p>\n<p>The announcement as resoundingly momentous about his inevitable succession was also unequivocal in its content. Imam Ali bin Talib (as) was publicly designated to be the successor of the Holy Prophet (saw).<\/p>\n<p>The explicit announcement made by the Holy Prophet (saw) after raising the hand of Imam Ali (as) clearly conveyed that Ali shall be his successor, inheritor, and the master of all the believers after him.<\/p>\n<p>The ardent devotees of Imam Ali (as) have been celebrating this day as Eid and it is popularly known as Eide Ghadeer, rather Eide Akbar or the greatest Eid.<\/p>\n<p>Many people erroneously believe that Muslims have two Eid,\u00a0 Eid Al Fitr and Eid Al Azha, and no celebration beyond these two. Before any further explanation, it is significant to understand the Arabic term, Eid.<\/p>\n<p>The word Eid is derived from the root word of Aada which means to return or recur, which means Eid is a day which recurs annually.<\/p>\n<p>The holy month of Ramzan and fasting culminates on 1st Shawwal and is celebrated as Eid Al Fitr. Nevertheless,\u00a0 the completion of the rituals of the holy pilgrimage of Hajj is celebrated as Eid Al Azha.<\/p>\n<p>The significant point is that even after the completion of the entire month of fasting, it only concludes Ramzan and not our religion. Similarly, with Eid Al Azha and efforts of pilgrimage, no Muslim can claim perfection of religion.<\/p>\n<p>Unexceptionally, Eid e Ghadeer is the day which not only perfected the religion of Islam but also completed the bounties of Allah. Following a revelation from Allah, the Holy Prophet (saw) assembled everyone and heralded his successor:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOf whomsoever, I am the Master, then Ali (as) is also his Master.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>(Sunane Tirmizi hadith no 3713)<\/p>\n<p>Famous Ahle Tasannun scholar, Ibne Asakir has recorded in his magnum opus, Tarikh Madinatul Damishq, in 42<sup>nd<\/sup> volume, pg 337, after the proclamation of the mastership of Ameerul Momineen Ali bin Abi Talib (as) the verse, \u2018Today I perfected your religion, completed my bounties on you and I am pleased for you with the religion of Islam\u2019\u00a0 (Maidah:3) was revealed. There is a general consensus among Muslims that the ayat was revealed on the day of Ghadeer.<\/p>\n<p>Even if we look at the common practice of the companions of the Holy Prophet (saw), we will realize the importance that they accorded to this day. Then why is it so difficult for Muslims to celebrate this auspicious day as Eid which was chosen by Allah to perfect His religion?\u00a0 As evidence and in the interest of brevity, we shall mention two authentic references here :<\/p>\n<p>Abu Hurairah has narrated that one who fasts on 18<sup>th<\/sup> Zilhajj then the reward for fasting on that day is equivalent to fasting for 60 months. And it was on the day of Ghadeer when the Holy Prophet (saw) raised the hand of Ali bin Abi Talib and asked \u201cAm I\u00a0 not the master of the believers?\u201d When everyone replied in affirmative. Then the Holy Prophet (saw) continued, <em>\u201c<\/em>Whoever regards me as his Master then Ali is his Master\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, it was Umar bin Khattab who congratulated Imam Ali (as) saying, \u201dKudos and accolades to you O Ali!\u00a0 Today you have become my master and the master of all the believers. (Tarikh Madintul Damishq, vol 42, pg 234)<\/p>\n<p>Ibne Talha Shafei has written on pg 79\u00a0 of his book Matalibus Souol fi Manaqibe Aale Rasul, \u2018The event of Ghadeer took place on 18<sup>th<\/sup> Zilhajj on a spot between Makka and Madina. Imam Ali (as) has himself mentioned this day as Eid in his poetry on myriad occasions. The day was commemorated as Eid of Ghadeer since\u00a0 the Holy Prophet (saw) bestowed such an exalted and noble position of mastership to Imam Ali (as) which was never given to anyone ever.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>These historical citations clearly indicate that Imam Ali himself remembered this day as nothing less than Eid. The congratulatory exclamations of Umar bin Khattab also prove that this was a unique status accorded to Imam Ali bin Abi Talib (as) which gives him supreme precedence as the successor to the Holy Prophet (saw)\u00a0 and announces his caliphate over the Muslim world. The felicitation only signifies that it was a practice of the sahaba of the Holy Prophet (saw) to celebrate this day as Eid. The Muslims generally celebrate on the day of Eid and convey approbatory messages to each other. The way the second caliph of Muslims expressed his compliments to Imam Ali (as). If someone does not celebrate this auspicious and the greatest Eid then it could only be due to one of the following reasons, either he is totally ignorant and clueless of the Islamic history and its established practices or he does not know the importance of the day of Ghadeer. As a Muslim, we are expected to follow Islam in its entirety.<\/p>\n<p>We should follow the precepts of the Holy Quran, teachings of the Holy Prophet (saw) and emulate the revered companions and celebrate the glorious day of Eid Ghadeer with all its fervour and gaiety. Muslims should meet their relatives and friends and exchange greetings with each other so that it should become amply evident that we are delighted on such a celebratory occasion.<\/p>\n<p>We present our heartfelt congratulations to all the Muslims on such a joyous day and pray to Allah through the exalted position of Imam Ali (as) that we remain steadfast on the righteous religion till our last breath which was perfected on the day of Ghadeer.<\/p>\n<p>We also pray for the expeditious reappearance of Allah\u2019s last vicegerent and the 12<sup>th<\/sup> successor of the Holy Prophet (saw), Imam Mahdi (as) whose advent will establish Ghadeeri Islam in the entire world.<\/p>\n<p>Aameen Rabbal Aalameen.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hearty Congratulations on the greatest Eid&#8211; Eide Ghadeer. \u00a0\u201cOf Whomever I am Master, this Ali is his Master,\u201d thus declared the Holy Prophet (saw) \u00a0The 18th Zilhajj in the 10th year of Hijri has marked the epoch in Islamic history.

The half-baked and slanted article not only exposes Abdul Hafeez\u2019s rancour towards the infallible family of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) but also to the lowest levels of partisanship that he is willing to stoop to manifest his animosity towards the Ahle Bait (a.s.) in general and Ameerul Mominee Ali Ibn Abi Talib (a.s.) in particular.<\/p>\n<p>The Maulvi has recklessly quoted an obscure interpretation of Surah Nisaa (4): Verse 43, &#8220;<strong>O you who believe! Do not go near the prayers whilst you are intoxicated<\/strong>,&#8221; that it refers to Ameerul Momineen Imam Ali Ibn Abi Talib (a.s.) whereas nothing could be further from the truth. Anyone would think twice before accusing even an ordinary companion of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and will exercise extra caution and discretion before ascribing such a malicious allegation. However, the Maulvi has no qualms about it and betrays total lack of conscience while audaciously writing against the best creation of Allah after the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.), best Companion of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.), son in law of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.), husband of Fatima Zahra (s.a.), Caliph of Muslims and the Commander of the faithful. What is further deplorable is that barring a few speakers, most of the other scholars \u2013 regardless of their sect \u2013 maintained a stoic silence on the subject and refrained from speaking out against the insult heaped on Imam Ali (a.s.). But, our honour and love for the Ahlul Bait (a.s.) and religious pride demand that such mischief should not be tolerated, and this Maulvi\u2019s cunning campaign should be effectively repudiated, thus unmasking his deception for the benefit of one and all.<\/p>\n<h2>Source of this Tradition<\/h2>\n<p>The supposed tradition which this Maulvi has presented as a citation to state his point is taken from the commentary of the Holy Quran by Ibn Kathir. The Maulvi further added that &#8220;<em>this tradition is also mentioned in Abu Dawood and Nisaa<\/em>i&#8221;. It is indeed surprising that a person who masquerades as a Maulvi is not even aware that Abu Dawood and Nisaai are not books but two authors of the Ahle Tasannun sect. Abu Dawood Sajistani&#8217;s book &#8216;Sunan&#8217; is included in &#8216;Sihah al-Sittah&#8217; (the six supposedly most authentic books of the Ahle Tasannun sect). Nisaai has two books under the name &#8216;Sunan&#8217;. One of them is \u2018Sunan al-Kubra\u2019 which is not included in Sihaah al-Sittah, and the other is \u2018Sunan al-Sughra\u2019 which is better known as \u2018Sunan Nisaai\u2019 and is included in the Sihaah al-Sittah. Incidentally, this Maulvi also failed to mention whether this tradition was taken from Sunan al-Kubra or Sunan al-Sughra. Perhaps his superficial study is yet to decipher such finer aspects of research. Nevertheless, ignorance cannot be packaged as \u2018research\u2019. In the interest of fairness, he should have referred to Ibn Kathir\u2019s Tafseer before jumping to a conclusion. But his bigotry and bias clearly disclose his deception or his hostility towards the family of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.). Nevertheless, it is essential to analyse this tradition to clarify the actual perspective so that the truth becomes clear to all Muslims.<\/p>\n<p>This tradition is found in Sunan Abi Dawood in the Book of Drinks, Chapter of the Prohibition of alcohol Hadith 3671 and in Sunan al-Kubra by Nisaai, vol. 10, p. 65, Hadith 11041.<\/p>\n<h2>Grading of this Tradition<\/h2>\n<p>An in-depth scrutiny of this tradition will reveal the following facts:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Both traditions have been declared authentic by well-known Salafi Scholars including Shaikh Naasiruddin Albaani, even though Nisaai himself did not consider this tradition authentic enough to be included in his Sunan al-Sughra. Albaani is notorious for his hatred and malice towards the Ahlul Bait (a.s.) and needs no explanation.<\/li>\n<li>In both the references, Ataa Ibn Saaeb and Abu Abd al-Rahmaan Sullami are the primary narrators. Whichever book reproduced this particular tradition has invariably narrated from these two narrators only which clearly establishes that this narration is classified as \u2018a single report\u2019 (Khabar-e-Waahid). One of the fundamentals of Ilm al-Hadith (the science of understanding traditions) is that no belief or cardinal principle can be established basis \u2018a single report\u2019.<\/li>\n<li>Ahle Tasannun scholar Imam Shawkani has written about Ataa Ibn Saaeb in his book Nayl al-Awtaar, vol. 8, p. 192 that this tradition was never narrated by anyone except Ataa Ibn Saaeb. On the same page, it is further written that Abu Bakr al-Bazzaar states, \u201cexcept for these two narrators we have not found this tradition reported from any other chain of narrators which is narrated regarding Imam Ali (a.s.)\u201d.<\/li>\n<li>Imam Shawkani also states that Mundhiri reports that there are serious conflicts in the authenticity and text of the tradition. The difference of opinion is related to the fact that it has been narrated by Sufiyan al-Thawri and Abu Jafar al-Raazi from Ataa Ibn Saaeb as a direct (Mursal)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><strong>Narrators of this Tradition (Sanad)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3>Ataa Ibn Saaeb<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Dhahabi writes about Ataa Ibn Saaeb in his book Seyar-o-A\u2019alaam al-Nobalaa, 6, pp. 111-112 that Wuhaib reports that when Ataa Ibn Saaeb came to Basra, he claimed he had jotted down 30 traditions from Ubaidah, when in fact, he had never heard any tradition from Ubaidah and this (Ataa\u2019s claim) was severely adulterated (and hence unreliable).<\/li>\n<li>Shaibah states, \u2018Although Ataa used to quote traditions but he suffered from severe amnesia. (Ibid, p. 112).<\/li>\n<li>Yahya narrates that Abu Awaanah had heard narrations from Ataa but he never used them as proof for any tradition narrated by him (Ibid).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Abu Abd al-Rahmaan Sullami<\/h3>\n<p>As far as the second narrator of this tradition, Abu Abd al-Rahmaan Sullami is concerned, it is found that he had intense hatred and enmity towards Imam Ali (a.s.). Abu Jafar al-Tabari has narrated in his book Muntakhab Min Dhayl al-Madheel, vol. 1, p. 147 that a man asked Abu Abd al-Rahmaan Sullami, \u201cI implore you for the sake of Allah! Since when have you borne malice against Ali (a.s.). Is not your rancour against him from the time he (Imam Ali (a.s.)) distributed the spoils of war in Kufa and did not allocate any share to you and your family?\u201d Abu Abd al-Rahmaan Sullami replied: \u201cSince you have sworn to me by Allah, my answer is yes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Even a layman will realize that one can only expect fabricated lies and slanderous statements from someone who bears enmity, animosity, and hatred towards Imam Ali (a.s.).<\/p>\n<h2>Text (Matn) of this Tradition<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The differences in the text of this tradition are related to the fact that:<\/p>\n<p>Abu Dawood and Tirmidhi wrote that congregational prayer was led by Imam Ali (a.s.)<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nisaai and Abu Jafar Nahhas have written that it was actually Abd al-Rahmaan Ibn Auf who led the prayers<\/li>\n<li>Abu Bakar al-Bazzaar differed with both these narrations and wrote that the prayers were led by a third person<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ali Ibn Ahmad Waahidi in his book Asbaab-o-Nuzool al-Quran, p. 158,316 narrated this same tradition from Ataa Ibn Saaeb but there is no mention of Imam Ali (a.s.) in the narration<\/li>\n<li>The same tradition is quoted by Muhammad Ibn Umar (otherwise known as Fakhruddin) al-Raazi in his Tafseer Mafaatih al-Ghaib (alias Tafseer-e-Kabeer) and under the exegesis of Surah Nisaa (4): verse 43, he has not mentioned the name of Imam Ali (a.s.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Such a conflict in text (Matn) and reports prove that it is nothing but a feeble attempt to defame the spotless and stainless life and character of Ameerul Momineen Imam Ali (a.s.).<\/p>\n<h2><strong>A <\/strong><strong>P<\/strong><strong>loy by the Kharijites<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Renowned Ahle Tasannun scholar Haakim Neyshaapoori\u00a0who researched on this tradition has written, \u201c<\/p>\n<p>The Kharijites have ascribed this intoxication and incorrect recitation (in prayers) to Imam Ali Ibn Abi Talib (a.s.) and none else, whereas certainly, Allah had kept him pure from such\u00a0acts even though he may, apparently, be the narrator of this tradition.\u201d [Al-Mustadrak Alaa al-Sahihain, vol. 2, p. 336, comment under H. 316; Nayl al-Awtaar, vol. 8, p. 192 (old edition) and vol. 15, p. 185 (new edition)]<\/p>\n<p>It means that according to Haakim Neyshaapoori, even though Imam Ali (a.s.) may be the apparent narrator of this tradition, this accusation cannot be attributed to him <strong><u>because he is divinely protected from these sins.<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><strong>Who <\/strong><strong>wa<\/strong><strong>s the <\/strong><strong>R<\/strong><strong>eal <\/strong><strong>Drunkard<\/strong><strong>?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>So far, we have presented only a few brief clarifications regarding the Hadith under contention and we hope these will resolve the issues for the just, judicious, and fair-minded people. Now we will prove how this Maulvi Abdul Hafeez\u00a0is an unscrupulous and untrustworthy man. His intentions were malafide and ignoble because, despite his improper and shallow research, he deliberately tried to hide behind the truth and brazenly denigrated his own fourth caliph and our first Imam Ameerul Momineen Imam Ali Ibn Abi Talib (a.s.). Let\u2019s examine the wily nature of this Maulvi and his shocking designs behind the ulterior motives about the massive cover-up that he orchestrated to protect the real drunkard and divert the attention by putting the allegation on Imam Ali (a.s.).<\/p>\n<p>The Hadith that he referred from Sunan Abi Dawood is tradition 3671 while if we just glance at the tradition before this one, that is tradition 3670 of the same book under the same chapter, a startling fact will come to light. The tradition is as follows:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAbbaad Ibn Musa al-Khuttali narrated from Ismail Ibn Ja\u2019far who narrated from Abu Ishaaq who reported from Amr and he in turn narrated from Umar Ibn Khattaab that, \u201cWhen the verse of prohibition of alcohol was revealed, Umar said: \u201cO Allah!

We want to make it clear to our readers that this was just one of the numerous traditions which, the Ahle Tasannun authors have recorded in their books in which prior to and post the revelation of the verse prohibition of alcohol, or for that matter even on his death bed, it is mentioned that Umar called for alcohol (<em>nabeez<\/em>).<\/p>\n<p>Another interesting thing is that this Maulvi has not even read Tafseer of Ibn Kathir carefully. Had he paid attention, he would have realized that in the commentary of Ibn Kathir, just like Sunan-o-Abi Dawood, the tradition of Umar Ibn Khattab has been recorded first under the exegesis of this verse. But this Maulvi has either ignored this tradition deliberately or the hatred of Imam Ali (a.s.) compelled him to hide the truth and, just like the Kharijites, propound fabrication and lies to tarnish the image of Ameerul Momineen Imam Ali Ibn Abi Talib (a.s.).\u00a0We would like to point out to Maulvi Abdul Hafeez that he should broaden his study before writing such an article in the future, otherwise facts consigned in the history books will be published in such newspapers and this Maulvi and his ilk will be held guilty for disrespecting their own revered leaders i.e. the so-called companions (Sahaba).<\/p>\n<p>This was still a short repudiation. If we narrate only the exegesis of Surah Nisaa (4): Verse 43 from the books of Ahle Tasannun scholars, then it will run into several pages.

In this incident, it is clearly mentioned that a needy person came and stood at the door of the house.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>References:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Amaali of Shaikh Saduq (a.r.), pp. 257-259, Majlis 41, H. 11<\/li>\n<li>Tafseer Noor al-Thaqalain, vol. 5, pp. 471-472<\/li>\n<li>Behaar al-Anwaar, vol. 35, pp. 237-239, H. 1<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The next famous incident is the one which is known as the tradition of \u2018shutting the doors\u2019 i.e. \u062d\u062f\u06cc\u062b \u0633\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628. This has been narrated by both Shia as well as Ahle Tasannun scholars. It is mentioned that one day Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.), on divine command, ordered all those people whose doors opened into Masjid al-Nabawi to be shut except the door of Imam Ali (a.s.). Except for Imam Ali (a.s.) none were permitted that their house doors should open into the mosque. One person asked for permission to have a keyhole in the door to look into the mosque.

It means that our Imams (a.s.) expect their Shias to recite this Dua every Friday and remember the burning door of Fatima Zahra (s.a.). If there was no door then this act of reciting Dua Nudbah and remembering that door will be rendered null and void.

The Prophet (s.a.w.a.) instructed: \u2018O Umar!

It mentions that Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) was so affectionate and merciful, especially to the new Muslims that anyone who came asking for anything, the Prophet (s.a.w.a.) used to fulfil \u2013 be it food, water, clothes, etc. When Ameerul Momineen (a.s.) states that they went through such times that their houses were devoid of roofs, it is a phrase used to denote that they patiently bore severe weather conditions. Houses without doors is also a phrase signifying that people used to come at any point of time to ask for their needs such the doors of their house remained open throughout for them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now that it is clear for us that the aforementioned tradition which the cynics misuse is a phrase used to highlight the tough times which the Ahlul Bait (a.s.) went through while propagation the divine religion in its initial period, we have a couple of questions for those very people who raise this objection \u2013<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The chapter under which this tradition was brought, especially in the book Al-Khesaal, is actually pertaining to the examination which Allah took of the successors of Prophets (a.s.).

Is this not cherry picking something which was seemingly suitable for them and ignoring the main topic under which the tradition was brought?<\/li>\n<li>Those who find it difficult to digest the innumerable virtues of Ameerul Momineen Imam Ali Ibn Abi Talib (a.s.) which Allah has bestowed upon him, try to make futile and frivolous attempts to equate some of their self-revered personalities with Imam Ali (a.s.). In order to do so, they even go to the extent of fabricating a famous tradition in which Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) said: <em>\u201cI am the city of knowledge and Ali is its door.\u201d<\/em> They tried to mischievously fabricate this tradition by adding that so-and-so person is its roof and another person is its window.

After this is the even more interesting part wherein the Almighty Allah says <strong><em>\u201cand Allah shall protect you from the people\u201d<\/em><\/strong>. Both of these aspects specifically indicate towards the fact that the message to be delivered is uncommon, dangerous and difficult.<\/p>\n<p>The command that not delivering this message will render all the previous efforts of Prophethood null and void speaks volumes. It means on one hand is the entire life of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) wherein despite all odds and under extreme duress and hardship, he still conveyed the divine message for 23 consecutive years, while on the other hand was delivering this one message. This clearly explains the importance and significance of the message.<\/p>\n<p>The other part of the verse wherein Allah states that He would protect you from the people also indicated the danger of the people not accepting it and rebelling against this divine message. Looking at the criticality and severity of the message, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) did not deny delivering it to the people. His only concern was that the people in front of whom he had to convey the message regarding the mastership of Imam Ali (a.s.), they should not revert to their days of paganism and ignorance and become apostates. But later when Allah guaranteed His protection, that is when the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) announced in Ghadeer Khum that \u2018<em>Of whomsoever I am the master, this Ali is his master too.<\/em>\u2019<\/p>\n<p><strong>Unreliable Companions or \u2018Hypocrites\u2019<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now if a question arises that why was the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) concerned about the people? After all, the people with him were his own companions and why would they defy his message? The point here is among the Muslims at that time, there were a large number of hypocrites. Of them, some were from Makkah and after migration their count just multiplied. Hence, it was quite possible that if any announcement regarding the mastership of Imam Ali (a.s.) was done during the journey, then those so-called companions might resort to violence and influence the other new Muslims to revert to their previous religion. These so-called companions were infamous and notorious of defying the orders of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.). All those stories behind the companions being very obedient and brave are all myths. Majority of them weren\u2019t so. There were only a handful of companions who remained true to the commands of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.). One reason for this misconception is a halo that has been created that anyone who saw the Prophet (s.a.w.a.) while he was a Muslim is a companion; rather, they have been elevated to an angelic status. The reality though was quite different. We recite in Surah Jumua (62): Verse 11 that<\/p>\n<div class=\"ar\">\n\u0648\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0630\u0627 \u0631\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0627 \u062a\u0650\u062c\u0627\u0631\u064e\u0629\u064b \u0623\u064e\u0648\u0652 \u0644\u064e\u0647\u0652\u0648\u0627\u064b \u0627\u0646\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0636\u064f\u0651\u0648\u0627 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u064e \u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0648\u0643\u064e \u0642\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0645\u0627\u064b \u0642\u064f\u0644\u0652 \u0645\u0627 \u0639\u0650\u0646\u0652\u062f\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0650 \u062e\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u064c \u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0652\u0648\u0650 \u0648\u064e \u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0650\u0651\u062c\u0627\u0631\u064e\u0629\u0650 \u0648\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u062e\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0632\u0650\u0642\u064a\u0646\u064e\n<\/div>\n<p><strong><em>\u201cAnd when they saw merchandise or idle-sport, they disperse for it and leave you standing; Say: Whatever is with Allah is better than idle-sport and from merchandise, and Allah is the best of the Sustainers.\u201d<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This proves that the hypocrites used to abandon the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and pursue their desires. There were also other vices found among them such as drinking alcohol which they tried to justify by calling it \u2018Nabeedh\u2019 which was nothing but wine. Although they liked being addressed as brave warriors, when it came to defending the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) in battles such as Ohod, Hunain and combating the enemies in Khaiber, history has not recorded any meaningful contributions by the so-called companions in such battles. What\u2019s more, a simple instruction by the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) wherein he asked for pen and paper in his last moments was not followed.<\/p>\n<p>If those hypocrites could not be trusted with such basic things like reciting prayers or actively participating in battles, how could they bear the mantle of the successorship of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.)? We should also remember that this message was about accepting the Wilaayah of the same Ali Ibn Abi Talib (a.s.) who was in the forefront of killing the disbelieving ancestors of some of these hypocrites. Those Arabs who were famous for years of fighting over petty issues like killing of their animals, how could they forget that it was Ali Ibn Abi Talib (a.s.) who had brought down their ancestors when they came to fight the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.). They always had the hatred of Imam Ali (a.s.) in their hearts and by no means they would readily accept this divine command.<\/p>\n<p>History is replete with incidents of friends turning foes for the sake of power and authority. Politics and propaganda are a clear proof for it. It was no different even for those hypocrites. This is evident from the incidents that occurred later. The concern of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) turned into a reality when, after his martyrdom, most of the people refused the accept the order of Allah, defied the open declaration at Ghadeer Khum and did not accept Imam Ali (a.s.) as their master and the first caliph.<\/p>\n<p>However, the assurance given by Allah the High in the latter part of the verse that \u2018<strong>Allah will save you from the people\u2019<\/strong> is what gave the strength to the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) to go ahead and make the announcement.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The matter of the mastership of Ameerul Momineen Imam Ali Ibn Abi Talib (a.s.) is such that even those who believe in him are skeptical about taking his name and spreading the true message fearing for their lives.

Eid al-Ghadeer. According to them, there are only two Eids for the Muslims viz. Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adh\u2019ha. On this basis, they consider the celebrations on the day of Ghadeer as Bid\u2019ah (innovation).<\/p>\n<p>Before answering this objection, let us quickly understand the meaning of the word \u201cEid\u201d. The Arabic word \u0639\u06cc\u062f (Eid) is derived from the root \u0639\u0627\u062f (\u2018Aada) which means \u2018to return\u2019 implying that the day of Eid returns every year. In all divine religions, any Eid was marked by celebrating a momentous occasion or a great achievement. The same practice is followed even by Muslims. For example, the 1st of Shawwal every year is celebrated as Eid al-Fitr because it marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan and hence is the cause of happiness for all the fasting Muslims. As a result, the Muslims celebrate this day as Eid and congratulate each other praying that the Almighty Allah accepts their all their deeds, especially fasting. Similarly, the day of completion of Hajj and as a mark of remembrance of the sacrifice by Prophet Ibrahim (a.s.), all Muslims celebrate and congratulate each other on Eid al-Adh\u2019ha.<\/p>\n<p>The day of Ghadeer marks the completion of not just the faith of Muslims but it is the day when the divine religion of Islam reached its completion and perfection.

In fact, they themselves celebrated that day. So why do their followers deny this greatest Eid in Islam? There could only be two reasons for this &#8211; (i) Either they are ignorant of the true Islamic history due to which they are not following their own leaders or (ii) They are aware but are deliberately misleading and deviating the general Muslims and keeping them away from accepting the rightful Wilayah (Mastership) of Ameerul Momineen Ali Ibn Abi Talib (a.s.) for some paltry worldly gains or power.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, it is a sincere appeal to all Muslims that &#8211;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you want your faith (Imaan) and Islam to be perfect<\/li>\n<li>If you want to follow Allah\u2019s religion in its true sense<\/li>\n<li>If you do not want to go against the Holy Quran and teachings of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>then follow, observe and celebrate this greatest Eid of Islam the way it should be because the rewards for celebrating this day are immense. The great Shia scholar Sayed Ibn Tawoos in his book Iqbaal al-A\u2019maal, vol. 1, pp. 464-465 narrates in a lengthy tradition from Imam Ali Ibn Moosa al-Reza (a.s.):<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201c\u2026 Whoever smiles looking at the face of his believing brother on the day of Ghadeer, Allah shall look at him on the day of Qiyamah with mercy, fulfill for him a thousand wishes, build for him a palace in Paradise made up of white pearl and illuminate his face because it is the day of adornment. So whoever adorns on the day of Ghadeer, Allah shall forgive for him every mistake committed by him, whether small or big and Allah shall raise an angel for him who will write good deeds for him, raise his grades until the same day in the next year. If he dies, he will die a martyr and if he lives, he will live a life of good fortune. Whoever feeds a believer it is as if he has fed all the divine Prophets (a.s.) and truthful ones.

Raising an objection is not a problem per se because all objections have been replied multiple times through authentic Shia as well as non-Shia books to prove the veracity of the incident.

However, we see that right from the very beginning of propagation, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) clearly called out that after him, his vicegerent, successor, Imam and Caliph would be Ali Ibn Abi Talib (a.s.). For example:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hadith Yaum al-Daar or Da\u2019wat Dhu al-Asheerah where the Noble Prophet (s.a.w.a.) said: <em>\u201cSurely he is my brother, my vicegerent, my Caliph among you. So, listen to him and obey him.\u201d<\/em> [Tarikh Tabari, vol. 2, p. 321]<\/li>\n<li>In the Battle of Badr, Imam Ali (a.s.) was the standard bearer of the army of Muslims<\/li>\n<li>In the Battle of Ohod, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) said about Imam Ali (a.s.): <em>\u201cHe is from me and I am from him.\u201d<\/em> [Tarikh Tabari, vol. 2, p. 514; Kanz al-Ummaal, vol. 5, p. 733, H. 14242]<\/li>\n<li>In Hadith of Manzelah, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) made it crystal clear that: <em>\u201cO Ali! You are to me as (Prophet) Haroon (a.s.) was to (Prophet) Moosa (a.s.) except that there would be no Prophet after me.\u201d<\/em> [Sahih Bukhari, Book 68, p. 438]<\/li>\n<li>In the event of Mubaahelah with the Christians of Najran, Imam Ali (a.s.) went as the \u2018self\u2019 (Nafs) of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and many other instances like Hadis al-Tair, Hadis Saqalain, the Verse of Tatheer, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Second Reply<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>During Hajj, it is not necessary that wherever the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) was, everyone else would also be at the same place at the same time. It could well be possible that had the announcement of the Wilayah of Imam Ali (a.s.) been done during that time, some people would have put forth an excuse that they were at another place performing another ritual of Hajj and hence missed the announcement. However, after Hajj was over and everyone was returning home together, there was no way that anyone would have missed this announcement and excused himself from accepting the mastership of Imam Ali (a.s.).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Third Reply<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The selection of a place for the announcement was very crucial. Johfa was a place right in the middle of a scorching desert and a place unsuitable for inhabitation as well. The only respite was the pond, which is known as Ghadeer in Arabic, from where people would quench their thirst. Selecting such a place for the announcement was actually breaking away from any routine announcement which would have been done otherwise inside a mosque or like it is stated in the objection, in Arafah or Makkah. Moving away from the routine meant that the location and climatic conditions would make it impossible for people to forget this announcement and leave no excuse for anyone on the Day of Resurrection. For example, conveying a message to a friend over a normal phone call during the day vis-\u00e0-vis calling up someone in the middle of the night and informing about something important. The latter case will not be easily erased from the memory of the person who was woken up in the middle of the night. Another more relatable example would be the calendar year 2020 itself. Everyone who has witnessed the year would always remember it as the year of the Coronavirus. Such memories are impossible to forget. The announcement at Ghadeer Khum did exactly that with the Muslims. The lengthy sermon, the 3-day halt in the sweltering heat and the special emphasis by the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) towards the end of his sermon that \u2018<strong><em>those present must convey the message to those absent\u2019<\/em><\/strong> ensured that it was impossible for anyone present there to forget the announcement that Imam Ali (a.s.) was the immediate successor of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.). Also, Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) ensured that whenever those people felt thirsty due to the sweltering heat, they would remember the thirst at Ghadeer Khumm and consequently the mastership of Imam Ali (a.s.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fourth Reply<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If the objection is pertaining to availability of more people in Arafah and lesser number of people in Ghadeer then it should be known that crowd and number of people neither was nor is a criterion for any announcement. If that\u2019s the case then all the announcements and propagation which was done in the earlier years in Makkah and Madinah should be rendered null and void because compared to the large gathering at Ghadeer, those audiences were very miniscule and insignificant.<\/p>\n<p>Most importantly, those who raise this objection must completely reject the incident of Saqifah and whatever transpired therein because \u2013 (i) It was a complete chaos and done in a very hush-hush manner (ii) Saqifah was a shady and notorious place (iii) Most of the companions including significant ones like Salman, Abu Dharr, Miqdad and even Imam Ali (a.s.) himself, were not present in Saqifah and (iv) Those present in Saqifah also did not know what would be the end result of that gathering.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fifth Reply<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This objection was never raised by anyone who attended and witnessed the announcement at Ghadeer Khum. In fact, history reveals that all those who were present there actually congratulated Imam Ali (a.s.) on being crowned as the \u2018Master\u2019 of believers. So, these questions and objections raised now really have no meat and are raised merely in the hatred for Shias and enmity for Ameerul Momineen Imam Ali Ibn Abi Talib (a.s.).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sixth Reply<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Objections of such nature have not been raised for the first time.

It does not take place taking into consideration the rules and principles coined by human beings. The event of Ghadeer took place upon the order of Allah and was conveyed by the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) upon divine command. Anyone who opposes the mastership of Imam Ali (a.s.) and does not accept him as the first caliph and the immediate successor of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) has actually defied this divine command and Prophetic message.

So what measures did Allah the High and His Noble Prophet (peace be on him and his progeny) take to prevent this disunity? What were the causes of this discord? Who is responsible for this disunity?<\/p>\n<p>At the outset, let us see the concepts and terms used by the Holy Quran: The first term is Balaa\/Ibtelaa. The second concept is al-fitnah\/al-iftenaan and the third term and concept is al-imtehaan.\u00a0 The Holy Quran has used these terms in several places, especially the first and the second concepts. Whether these are having different applications or are they synonyms is a different issue. We have just named our topic: Test (al-Ikhtebaar). It should be known that testing the people \u2013 individually as well as collectively \u2013 is a Divine Tradition. It was done in the past, is being done presently and will continue till the Day of Judgment. As the Holy Quran says: \u201c<strong>And you will not find any change in Allah\u2019s tradition<\/strong>\u201d (Surah Ahzab (33): Verse 62).<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there are various ways and means to examine the people. Sometimes, He tests through deprivation of worldly things and calamities. As He says: \u201c<strong>And certainly We will test you with something of fear, hunger and deficit of wealth, lives and fruits and give glad tidings to those who exercise patience.<\/strong>\u201d (Surah Baqarah (2): Verse 155).<\/p>\n<p>At other times, this test is with comfort and opulence. \u201c<strong>And We will test you with evils as well as goodness, as a test. And unto Us is your return<\/strong>.\u201d (Surah Anbiya (21): Verse 35)<\/p>\n<p>Just as Allah tests us with the aforementioned worldly things, He also examines us with the matters of religion and faith. Like He says, \u201c<strong>Do the people think that they will be left alone if they say \u2018We have believed\u2019 and they will not be tested?<\/strong> <strong>And surely We have tested those before them; then certainly Allah knows those who have spoken the truth and knows the liars<\/strong>.\u201d (Surah Ankbaoot (29): Verse 2)<\/p>\n<p>Is it sufficient that a person claims that he is a believer and that he will not be tested? Nay! This nation will be tested as much \u2013 if not more \u2013 than the previous nations. Obviously, the spiritual test is more difficult, dangerous and significant than the worldly examination. As has come in the traditions, \u201c<em>A person will get up in the morning as a believer and by evening, he will be a disbeliever<\/em>.\u201d (Al-Kafi, vol. 2, p. 418, H. 2 Baab al-Moaareen)<\/p>\n<p><u>Nobody should think that he is a believer now so he will remain a believer at the time of his death. Rather, he should strive for the protection of his religion from both aspects \u2013 faith as well as action \u2013 till his last breath<\/u>.<\/p>\n<p>Allah the High says in the Holy Quran, \u201c<strong>And the final (good) end is only for the pious ones<\/strong>.\u201d (Surah A\u2019raaf (7): Verse 128)<\/p>\n<p>And in a Hadis-e-Qudsi, He the High says, \u201c<em>Deeds are judged by their end<\/em>.\u201d (Ghavaali al-L\u2019aali, p. 289)<\/p>\n<p>Of course, divine tests and examinations have their own rationale. Allah the High says, \u201c<strong>So that Allah may sieve the wretched from the pure.<\/strong>\u201d (Surah Anfaal (8): Verse 37)<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201c\u2026and that Allah might test what was in your chests and that He might purge what was in your hearts; and Allah knows what is in the chests\u201d <\/strong>(Surah Aale Imran (3): Verse 154)<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201c\u2026so that We may see how you act<\/strong>.<strong>\u201d <\/strong>(Surah Yunus (10): Verse 14)<\/p>\n<p><u>Now, we come to our moot discussion i.e. the test of the Muslim nation with the mastership of the Ahle Bait (a.s.). <\/u><\/p>\n<p>The Holy Quran says: \u201c<strong>And be not like those who became divided and disagreed after clear arguments had come to them, and these it is that shall have a grievous chastisement<\/strong>.\u201d (Surah Aale Imran (3): Verse 105)<\/p>\n<p>The above verse is addressing this nation viz. the Muslims and warns them from emulating the previous nations\u2019 acts like division and disagreement after clear signs had come to them.<\/p>\n<p>But we see that in the authentic and reliable traditions of books of both sects, it is clearly recorded that this nation will follow in the footsteps of the previous nations. In other words, whatever has happened in the previous nations will take place exactly the same in this nation. Imam Muhammad Baqir (peace be on him) informs: <em>Surely the Jews were divided into 71 groups after Prophet Moosa (peace be on him). One group from these will go to Paradise and the remaining will go to Hell. The Christians were divided into 72 groups after Prophet Eesa (peace be on him). One group from these will go to Paradise and the remaining will go to Hell. This nation (viz. Muslims) too will be divided after their Prophet (peace be on him and his progeny) into 73 sects, of which 72 will go to Hell and only one will go to Paradise.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>(Kafi, vol. 8, p. 224, H. 283)<\/p>\n<p>Thus, while the Holy Quran and the Prophet of Allah (peace be on him and his progeny) have prohibited the nation from being divided, he (peace be on him and his progeny) has also prophesied that this nation will certainly be divided into factions, of which only one will go to Paradise and the rest will go to Hell.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, this order from Allah the High is tashreei\u2019 and hence, the ultimate volition rests with man and the nation. There is no force and compulsion in religion.<\/p>\n<p>Now, if disagreement is clearly prohibited, then who is responsible for its occurrence in this nation? The answer is Satan and man following his carnal desires and his love for position, power and pelf in this world. Hence, there is a famous narration from the Holy Prophet (peace be on him and his progeny): \u201c<em>Those who divide their religion and become in groups, they are the people of innovation. I am distanced from them and they are far from me.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>(Al-Mojam al-Sagheer by Tabaraani, vol. 1, p. 338; Hilyah al-Auliyaa by Abu Noaim Isfahani, vol. 4, p. 138)<\/p>\n<p>Ameerul Momineen (peace be on him) says: \u201c<em>How surprising! And why should I not be surprised due to the mistake of these groups upon the differences of their arguments in their religion? They did not follow in the footsteps of the Prophet nor did they emulate the action of the successor nor did they believe in the unseen nor did they pardon the mistakes.

But using this method, not only the excellence\nof Ali (peace be on him) was manifested for one and all, even Abu Bakr was\nshown his place so that tomorrow he cannot make any tall and false claims for\nhis superiority.

people of hell in hell, a man will stay in hell for seventy\nseasons while each season is seventy years. Thereafter, he will ask Allah \u2013\nMighty and Majestic be He \u2013 and call out to Him, saying, \u2018O Lord! I ask You for\nthe right of Muhammad and His Household that You have mercy on me\u2019. Allah \u2013\nMighty be His Majesty \u2013 will reveal to Jibraeel (peace be on him), \u2018Go to My\nservant and bring him out (from hell)\u2019. Jibraeel (peace be on him) will ask,\n\u2018How can I go down in the hell-fire?\u2019 Allah \u2013 Blessed and High be He \u2013 will\nreply, \u2018Indeed, I have ordered it (hell-fire) to be safe and cold for\nyou\u2019.&nbsp; Again, Jibraeel (peace be on him)\nwill reason, \u2018O Lord! But I don\u2019t know his place (i.e. where is he in hell). \u2019\nAllah will inform, \u2018He is in a well of Sijjeen\u2019. Thus, Jibraeel (peace be on\nhim) will descend in the hell-fire and will find him tied on his face and will\nbring him out. He will stand in front of Allah \u2013 Mighty and Majestic be He.\nAllah \u2013 the High \u2013 will ask him, \u2018O My servant! How long were you in fire\ncrying out to me?\u2019 He will respond, \u2018O Lord! I cannot enumerate it.\u2019 Allah \u2013\nMighty and Majestic be He \u2013 will tell him, \u2018I swear by My Might and My Majesty!\nHad it not been for those with whose right you asked Me, I would have prolonged\nyour disgrace in the Hell-fire. But I have made it obligatory on Myself that\nnone will ask Me for the right of Muhammad and his Household but that I will\nforgive him for all the sins that he has committed against Me. And indeed,\ntoday I have forgiven you\u2019. Thereafter, he will be ordered to go to Paradise\u2019.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Al-Amaali of al-Shaikh al-Mufeed (r.a.), p. 218, H. 6, 25<sup>th<\/sup>\nMajlis <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behaar al-Anwaar, vol. 27, p. 312, H. 5<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Notes:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the mercy of Allah the High is that those who will go to\nParadise will never come out of it but those who go to Hell have the option to\ncome out of it, albeit with some terms and conditions <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fire becoming cold and safe for Jibraeel (peace be on him)\nlike it became for Prophet Ibrahim (peace be on him) proves that effect of\nanything does not belong to it essentially except with the permission of Allah\nthe Almighty<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The essence of the narration is that if a person asks Allah the\nHigh for anything whether in this world or the Hereafter, his plea will be\naccepted immediately. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \u201c\u2026<em>for all the sins that he has committed <strong>against Me<\/strong>.\u201d\n<\/em>This phrase shows that only those sins that he has committed against Allah\nwill be forgiven and not those in which he has trampled upon the rights of the\npeople. \n\n5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another important point in the\nnarration is the selection of Hazrat Jibraeel (peace be on him) by Allah the\nHigh to perform this task of removing this sinner from the hell-fire. It should\nbe noted that Hazrat Jibraeel (peace be on him) is from the most proximate\nangels of Allah. So the question arises as to why Allah has selected him for\nthis task of bringing out a sinner from the hell-fire? Any other angel could\nhave carried out this lowly task?&nbsp; The\nanswer is simple: Since the sinner has invoked the Holy Prophet and His\nhousehold (peace be on them all), this invocation carries tremendous significance\nin the eyes of the Creator. Hence, now this sinner and this task is no longer\nlowly.

<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Abu Taher al-Alawi\r\nreports, \u201cMy father informed me vide his father that the latter was with Imam\r\nAbu Jafar Muhammad Ibn Ali (peace be on them both) at Mena (in Makkah) while he\r\n(my grandfather) was throwing pebbles (at the devils) and Imam Abu Jafar (peace\r\nbe on him) too was throwing pebbles (<em>ramy al-jamaaraat<\/em> \u2013 stoning the\r\ndevils, a ritual of Hajj). He (peace be on him) completed the ritual while\r\nstill five pebbles remained in his hand. He (peace be on him) threw two\r\npebbles in one direction and the other three in another direction. My grandfather\r\nasked him, \u2018May I be held your ransom! I saw doing something which I have never\r\never seen anybody else do before! First, you did the ritual of stoning the\r\ndevils. Thereafter, you threw the remaining pebbles, two in one direction and\r\nthe other three in another direction\u2019. He (peace be on him) replied, \u2018<em>Yes.\r\nEvery year in the season (of Hajj), the TWO transgressors and usurpers are\r\ntaken out from their graves and both are separated here. None can see them\r\nexcept a just Imam (i.e. appointed by Allah). So I threw the two stones at the\r\nfirst one and the remaining three at the second one because the latter is more\r\nwretched than the former\u2019.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2

chronicles,\n\u201cI entered the (holy city of) Madinah while with me was my slave-girl. I had\nconjugal relations with her, after which I went to the public bath (for taking\nghusl). There, I met some of our Shia companions who were going to meet (Imam)\nJafar Ibn Muhammad (peace be on them both). I feared that they will go ahead\nand I will miss the opportunity of going to him (peace be on him). So I started\nwalking with them till we entered the (holy) house with them. When I came in\nfront of (Imam) Abu Abdillah (peace be on him), he looked at me and said, \u2018<em>O\nAba Baseer! Don\u2019t you know that the houses of the Prophets and the offspring of\nthe Prophets (peace be on them all) are not entered in a state of impurity?\u2019 <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt ashamed and\nsaid to him, \u2018O son of Allah\u2019 Messenger! I meet our companions and feared that\nI will the miss the opportunity of meeting you with them.

I sought\npermission from him. He allowed me. When I entered, he told me, \u2018O Ali! Don\u2019t\nyou know that my house is your house? Then why do you seek permission to\nenter?\u2019 I replied, \u2018O Messenger of Allah! I love to do this\u2019. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be on him and\nhis progeny) reassured, \u2018O Ali! You love whatever Allah loves and have adopted\nthe etiquette of Allah. O Ali! Don\u2019t you know that my Creator and my Sustainer\nhas not allowed me to have any confidante other than you? O Ali! You are my\nsuccessor after me and you will be oppressed and repressed after me. O Ali! The\none who is steadfast with you is like the one who is standing with me and the\none who parts with you has parted with me. O Ali! He has lied who thinks that\nhe loves me but bears malice against you because Allah \u2013 the High \u2013 has created\nyou and me from one light\u2019.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meah Manqebah, p. 59, Manqebah No. 33<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kanz al-Fawaaed, vol. 2, p. 55<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behaar al-Anwaar, vol. 27, p. 230, H. 38 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This tradition further endorses the concept of the Verse of\nMalediction (Aayah Mubaahalah) and numerous other evidences that Ali (peace be\non him) is the self of the Holy Prophet (peace be on him and his\nprogeny). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, these two great teachers of humanity want to show that\ndespite their high positions, they follow the etiquette prescribed by Allah the\nHigh. That is, when we enter into each other\u2019s house, we must seek permission. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, when the believers go for visitation (<em>ziyaarat<\/em>)\nof the infallible guides (peace be on them), before entering any shrine, they\nmust recite the supplication of permission. One must never think that since the\nowner of the shrine is no longer in this material world, no permission is\nrequired. This is certainly not the case.

The converse also holds\ntrue. Of course, history is a witness that those who were steadfast were very\nfew in number that they could be counted on fingers. \n\n5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly and most importantly, the\nMessenger of Allah (peace be on him and his progeny) is talking about Ali\n(peace be on him) being oppressed and repressed by his own nation and followers\nafter his martyrdom. Ali is the one whose right was usurped, he was confined to\nhis house, while he was seeing his inheritance being plundered. That is, the\nreligion of Allah was being played with. Preposterous answers were given to\nquestions raised about divine beliefs like monotheism. Quran was being\nwhimsically interpreted. Its meanings and concepts were being distorted.

I swear by the One Who\nraised me as a Prophet! Allah will not accept any good deed from a person till\nHe will question him about the love of Ali Ibn Abi Talib (peace be on them\nboth) while He \u2013 the Highest \u2013 knows the best. If he (the servant) brings his\n(Ali\u2019s) mastership, his actions will be accepted as they are (i.e. regardless\nof their quality) but if he does not bring his mastership, Allah will not ask\nhim about anything else and order that he be taken to the hell. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>O son of Abbas! I swear\nby the One Who raised me as a Prophet with truth! Verily, the hell-fire will be\nmore intense in punishment on the one who hates Ali (peace be on him) than the\none who thinks that Allah has taken a son for Himself. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>O son of Abbas! If all\nthe proximate angels and sent messengers gather on his (Ali\u2019s) hatred \u2013 which\nthey will never do \u2013 Allah will certainly punish them with hell\u2019. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked, \u2018O Messenger\nof Allah! Will someone (actually) hate him (Ali)?\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be on him\nand his progeny) retorted,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018O son of Abbas! Yes. A\ngroup will hate him who will be remembered as being from my nation while Allah\nhas not made for them any portion from Islam. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>O son of Abbas! The sign\nof their hatred for him is their giving preference (i.e. considering superior)\nto someone else other than him. I swear by the One Who sent me with the truth!\nAllah has not raised a Prophet nobler in His eyes than me nor from the\nsuccessors nobler in His eyes than my successor Ali\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ibn Abbas says,\n\u201cThereafter, I continuously followed as the Messenger of Allah (peace be on him\nand his progeny) ordered me and advised me for his (Ali\u2019s) love. Surely, it\n(Ali\u2019s company and his love) was my greatest action near me.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Al-Amaali of\nal-Shaikh al-Toosi (r.a.), p. 105, 4th Majlis&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Al-Fazaael, p. 5<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kashf al-Ghummah,\nvol. 1, p. 380<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kashf al-Yaqeen, p.\n462<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behaar al-Anwaar,\nvol. 27, p. 219, H. 4<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Notes:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above tradition proves that the love and mastership of Ali\nIbn Abi Talib (peace be on them both) is first and last. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comparison of punishment of the denier of Ali\u2019s mastership with\nthe one who believes that Allah has taken a son for Himself and then saying\nthat the former\u2019s punishment will be worse than the latter shows the intensity\nand seriousness of the matter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hatred of Ali (peace be on him) destroys all the good deeds\nof a person, based on the principle \u2018Surely the bad deeds destroy the good\ndeeds\u2019.

That is, to believe that others are prior to and superior\nto Ali (peace be on him). So, even if a person apparently claims to love Ali\n(peace be on him) but does not believe him as the immediate successor of the\nHoly Prophet (peace be on him and his progeny) and as the most superior of his\ncompanions, then it will imply that he does not love Ali (peace be on him) but\nhates him.&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u0639\u064e\u0646\u0650

He responded,\n\u2018I have already done it\u2019 and continued, \u2018I have made specific for him a test\nwith which I have not inflicted anyone from your nation\u2019. I pleaded, \u2018He is my\nbrother and my companion!\u2019&nbsp; Allah\nretorted, \u2018This is what I have already decided from before that surely he will\nbe tested and through him people will be tested\u2019.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Al-Amaali of al-Shaikh Abu Jafar al-Toosi (r.a.), p. 513, 18<sup>th<\/sup>\nMajlis<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behaar al-Anwaar, vol. 27, p. 208, H. 3<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Notes: <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The word \u2018<em>Listen\u2019<\/em> in the tradition is for importance. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2018<em>Bound with pious ones<\/em>\u2019 implies that his mastership is the\ncriterion for piety and fear of God. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2018<em>Spring of faith<\/em>\u2019 implies the highest level of faith and\nbelief. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The greater the position a person enjoys in front of Allah the\nAlmighty, the more calamities and difficulties he faces in this world.

For example, praying two units of prayers in Makkah\nal-Mukarramah has greater reward than the same act of worship in any other\nordinary city of the world. Similarly, committing a prohibited act in a holy\ncity like Madinah or Karbala is a greater sin than committing it in an ordinary\ncity. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same applies for timings too. For example, committing\nadultery on Thursday evening has greater punishment than committing on any\nother night.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Importantly,<\/strong> according to many traditions, the\nhallowed city of Karbala al-Muallaa bears more significance than the holy city\nof Makkah al-Mukarramah. Then why Imam Sajjad (peace be on him) has talked\nabout Makkah being the holiest land? The reason is that Imams (peace be on\nthem) used to talk to the people as per the levels of intellects and\nunderstanding. All things are not said to all people at all times. We have\nnumerous traditions that the Prophets (peace be on them) used to speak to the\npeople as per the levels of their intellects. Moreover, even we Shias have been\nordered by the Imams (peace be on them) to talk to the people as per the levels\nof their intellects. If someone speaks everything he knows, then it is\nsufficient to prove his ignorance. (Ghurar al-Hikam, H. 4137). Hence, it is\npossible that Imam (peace be on him) is comparing Makkah to other ordinary\nlands and not Karbala. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The likeness of the life of Prophet Nooh (peace\nbe on him) is to show longevity.

Yet,\nthey have no right to appoint by themselves any judges, since that is up to a\nhigher authority. So, the judges have no right to be absolute arbitrators.\nTheir right is confined to judging among the people only, while Allah can judge\namong the people according to His own decision, and can give permission to\nothers to judge since He is the Absolute Ruler. Therefore, when the Prophets (peace\nbe upon them) judge, they judge according to Allah\u2019s judgment. Similar is the\njudgement of the two who judge as arbitrators between a man and his wife.\nConsequently, their judgment \u2013 if they judge according to Allah\u2019s order \u2013 is the\nvery judgment of Allah, not without Allah, nor together with Allah. It is a\njudgment on Allah\u2019s order and a judgment by Allah\u2019s permission. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Referring to only one type\nof verses without studying their context and other verses on that same topic\nwill only result in flawed verdicts. The Wahhaabi ideology of referring to only\none type of verses which are as per their liking has led to the rise of extremism\nin Islam. They consider only themselves to be true Muslims and everyone else,\nespecially the Shia, as polytheists. As a result, practices such as mass\nbeheading of the innocent ones started because they consider the blood of those\nwho do not to match with their ideology to be lawful. However, little do they\nunderstand that if at all there is any faction or group from among the Muslims\nwho is the farthest from the true teachings of Islam and Holy Quran, it is they\nviz. the Wahhaabis.

Also, no forbidden act is performed while celebrating such birthdays.

Shias believe in\nAmeerul Momineen Ali Ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon both of them) to be the rightful Imam and the\nimmediate successor of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny). The Ahle Tasannun\nalso believe in the caliphate of Imam Ali (peace be upon him) but after three rulers who were\nnot directly appointed by the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny). One of the proofs\nwhich they cite to defend the caliphate and superiority of the first of the\nthree rulers is that he was with the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) when the latter took\nshelter in a cave during his migration (Hijrah) from Makkah al-Mukarramah to\nMadinah al-Munawwarah. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Couple of questions which should\narise in the mind of any wise person here are \u2013 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Does merely staying with\nthe Holy Prophet (peace be upon\nhim and his progeny) in the cave makes a person eligible for caliphate? <\/li><li>Does this so-called\ncompanionship in the cave grant superiority to a person over all others?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahle Tasannun scholars believe\nthat the answer to both these questions is in the affirmative. Have they ever\nasked themselves that when the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) safely moved out\nof his house in Makkah al-Mukarramah unscathed and unnoticed, what prompted him\nto take shelter in a cave? There is an answer to this question as well but we\nwill respond to that separately. For now, our response to the aforementioned\ntwo questions around companionship and superiority is that if few hours of\nstaying together make a person a superior companion and eligible for caliphate\nthen what about Imam Ali (peace\nbe upon him) who possesses many more characteristics through which both,\nhis superiority and his eligibility for caliphate, can be easily proved? We\npresent only two proofs as a response to both questions and the Ahle Tasannun scholars\nthemselves confess to these facts:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Imam Ali <\/strong><strong>(peace be upon him) was trained\nby the Holy Prophet <\/strong><strong>(peace be upon him and his progeny) since childhood<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During a famine in Makkah, the\nHoly Prophet (peace be upon him\nand his progeny) told his uncle Abbas, that the latter&#8217;s brother, Abu\nTalib (peace be upon him),\nhad too many children, and that his means of livelihood were narrow.

Many people have tried to use this verse to their liking by using their flawed understanding to interpret it. They do not realise that it is forbidden to interpret the Holy Quran without referring to the teachings of Ahle Bait (peace be upon them). There are traditions which clearly state that nothing is more distant from the intellects of men than exegesis (Tafseer) of the Holy Quran. It means people do not have the ability or capacity to interpret the Quran by themselves and the Quran cannot be understood except by referring to the Ahle Bait (peace be upon them), who are its real addressees. As a result, when people venture into self-interpretation of Quranic verses, the outcome is contrary to the divine command. This approach is not very far from the approach of those who claimed that the Holy Quran is sufficient for us.

The Hadith of Manzelat is one of the proofs that Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) has the same position of the successor to Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) just as Prophet Haroon was to Prophet Moosa (peace be upon both of them). But since the opponents of Shias cannot deny the clarity of its content, they try to limit its context.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They claim that the Hadith of Manzelat is only limited to the battle of Tabuk when the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) left behind Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) in Madinah to manage the affairs of the people and therefore this tradition cannot be accepted as a proof of his immediate caliphate after the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reply:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is the Hadith of Manzilat?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his absence of forty days, Prophet Moosa (peace be upon him) did not leave matters to the discretion of his followers. He appointed Prophet Haroon (peace be upon him), the best man among the Bani Israel, to act as his Caliph and successor. Similarly, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him and his progeny), whose religion is most perfect, had even greater reason to protect his people from the chaos of their free-will. He preserved the code of religion so that it might not pass into the hands of the ignorant, those who would change it according to their whims. The ignorant people would depend on their own conjecture and create divisions in the matter of divine laws. So, in this sacred hadith, the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) informed Imam Ali (peace be upon him) that, <em>\u201cYou are to me as Haroon was to Moosa, except that there will be no Prophet after me\u201d<\/em> confirming that Imam Ali (peace be upon him) held the same levels of merit and authority as Prophet Haroon (peace be upon him) did. Imam Ali (peace be upon him) was superior to the whole Ummah (community) and therefore the Prophet appointed him his helper and his successor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hadith of Manzilat on multiple occasions acknowledged by Ahle Tasannun scholars<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The assumption and claim that the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) narrated the tradition of Manzilat only at the time of the battle of Tabuk is false. He (peace be upon him and his progeny) gave this glad tiding to Imam Ali (peace be upon him) on multiple occasions other than the battle of Tabuk. These occasions and instances have been narrated in the books of the Ahle Tasannun themselves. Among them are \u2013<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Muruj al-Dhahab by Ali Ibn Husain Ibn Ali al-Masudi, vol. 2, p. 49<\/li>\n<li>Seerat al-Halabiyyah by Ibrahim Ibn Muhammad Ibn Ibrahim al-Halabi, vol. 2, p. 26 and p. 120<\/li>\n<li>Khasaais al-Alawiyyah by Abd al-Rahmaan al-Nisaai, p. 19<\/li>\n<li>Tazkirah al-Khawaas by Sibt Ibn Jauzi, pp. 13-14<\/li>\n<li>Yanaabi\u2019 al-Mawaddah by Haafiz Sulaiman al-Qunduzi al-Balkhi al-Hanafi, chapters 9 and 17<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We will just quote the tradition from Yanaabi\u2019 al-Mawaddah as a proof:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahmad Ibn Hanbal mentions in his Musnad from Zaid Ibn Abi Aufa who said, \u201cWhen the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) was establishing brotherhood between his companions, Ali (peace be upon him) said,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cO Messenger of Allah! You have established brotherhood between all the companions but have not established my brotherhood with anyone.\u201d <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) replied,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cBy the One who raised me as a Prophet with truth, I have not left you until the end except for myself, as you are to me what Haroon was to Moosa except that there will not be a Prophet after me. And you are my brother and my inheritor and you will be with me in my palace in paradise with my daughter Fatima (peace be upon her) and you are my brother and my friend.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Yanaabi\u2019 al-Mawaddah by Haafiz Sulaimaan al-Qunduzi, chapter 9 and 17]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several others have also narrated this tradition. They all say that, apart from the two occasions of establishing brotherhood, it has been narrated on many other occasions as well. Therefore, this hadith is not to be construed in a restricted sense or for a particular occasion only. Its general significance is an established fact. It was through this hadith that the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) declared on appropriate occasions Imam Ali&#8217;s (peace be upon him) succession after him. One of those occasions was the Battle of Tabuk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence, the Hadith of Manzilat is just another proof that Imam Ali (peace be upon him) is the rightful and immediate successor of Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny). Denial of this tradition or its applicability at all times only reflects over the bias and prejudice which the opponents of Shias bear in their hearts.

They allege that this sect and its beliefs were propounded by Abdullah Ibn Sabaa, who was originally a Jew but had later accepted Islam along with Ka\u2019ab al-Ahbaar and Wahab Ibn Munabbah. All three had accepted Islam but created confusion among Muslims. The third caliph Usmaan Ibn Affaan drove them away. They fled to Egypt and formed a sect called \u2018Shia\u2019. They fabricated traditions of Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) and claimed that Imam Ali (peace be upon him) is his successor and created a chaos which led to the murder of Usmaan Ibn Affaan and Imam Ali (peace be upon him) then assumed caliphate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reply:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is quite absurd and there is no sense in associating the name of Abdullah Ibn Sabaa with the Shias.

In fact, it was the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) himself who introduced the word Shia in the meaning of \u201cfollower of Ali Ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon both of them).\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The word \u2018Shia\u2019 was used by Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to the allegation of the opponents, the word Shia originated much before the reign of Usmaan Ibn Affaan.

When all created beings assemble for reckoning, your face will be bright, and you will be identified on that day as the leader of the bright-faced people.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Al-Manaaqib by Muwaffaq Ibn Ahmad al-Khwarazmi<\/li>\n<li>Shawaahid al-Tanzeel by Haakim Abdullah Ibn Abdullah al-Haskaani<\/li>\n<li>Kifaayah al-Talib, p. 19 by Muhammad Ibn Yusuf Ganji al-Shaafei<\/li>\n<li>Tazkirah al-Khawaas, p. 31 by Sibt Ibn Jauzi<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In another tradition from Al-Manaaqib by Khwarazmi it is narrated from Jabir Ibn Abdullah Ansari (may Allah have mercy upon him) who says that, \u201cI was in the presence of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) when Ali (peace be upon him) joined us, and thereupon the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) said: <em>\u2018It is my brother who has come to you.\u2019<\/em> Then, facing towards the Holy Kaabah, the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) caught hold of Imam Ali&#8217;s (peace be upon him) hand and said: <em>\u2018By Him, Who controls my life, this Ali and his Shias will attain salvation on the Day of Judgement.\u2019<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Chapter 2 of the book Sawaaiq al-Muhriqah, Ibn Hajar al-Haythami quotes Haafiz Jamaluddin Muhammad Ibn Yusuf Zarandi Madani, a great Ahle Tasannun scholar, that when the above verse was revealed, Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) said: <em>\u201cO Ali, you and your Shia are the best of created beings. You and your Shias will come on the Day of Judgement in such a condition that all of you will be pleased with Allah, and Allah will be pleased with you. Your enemies will be resentful, and their hands shall be tied round their necks.\u201d<\/em> Then Ali (peace be upon him) asked who was his enemy? The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) replied, <em>\u201cOne who is hostile to you, and who reviles you.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The well-known anti-Shia scholar, Ibn Hajar, in his famous book Sawaaiq al-Muhriqah narrates from Umm al-Momineen Umm Salma (peace be upon her), that the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) said twice: <em>\u201cO Ali, you and your Shias will abide in Paradise.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, even in the Holy Prophet&#8217;s (peace be upon him and his progeny) era, several noted companions were called Shias. Haafiz Abu Haatim Razi, in his Al-Zainat, which he compiled for clarifying the meanings of certain words and phrases current among scholars, says that the first new word that came into general acceptance in Islam in the days of the Prophet was \u2018Shia\u2019. The word was applied to four prominent companions: Abu Dharr al-Ghifaari, Salman al-Farsi, Miqdad Ibn Aswad al-Kindi, and Ammaar Yasir. Many more traditions were quoted in support of the same point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, the allegation that Abdullah Ibn Sabaa was the founder of Shiaism and that the word Shia was his creation is completely baseless. In fact, the word \u2018Shia\u2019 was used by the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) himself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Adapted from the famous book \u2018Peshawar Nights\u2019, the Second Session <\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Another baseless allegation by the opponents of Shias is related to the origin of the Shia word and the sect itself.

(peace be on him)\nentered Neshaapoor while he (peace be on him) was riding a grey mule. The\nscholars of Neshaapoor came out to welcome him. When he (peace be on him)\nreached to the (last) district (of Neshaapoor) called al-Marba\u2019ah, they held\nthe reins of his mule and said, \u2018O son of Allah\u2019s Messenger (peace be on him\nand his progeny)! For the sake of your pure ancestors, narrate unto us a\ntradition from your ancestors (peace be on them all). So, he (peace be on him)\nbrought his head out from the mule\u2019s litter while there was a silken shawl on\nhim (peace be on him) and said,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018My father, Moosa Ibn Ja\u2019far (peace be on them both) narrated\nto me from his father Ja\u2019far Ibn Muhammad (peace be on them both) from his\nfather Muhammad Ibn Ali (peace be on them both) from his father Ali Ibn\nal-Husain (peace be on them both) from his father al-Husain, the Chief of the\nyouth of Paradise (peace be on him) from his father Ameerul Momineen (peace be\non him) from the Messenger of Allah (peace be on him and his progeny) who said,\n\u2018Jibraeel, the trustworthy spirit (peace be on him) informed me from Allah \u2013\npurified be His Names and Majestic be His Face \u2013 that He said, \u2018Surely I am\nAllah, there is no god except Me. I am Alone. O My servants! Worship Me Alone\nand know that whoever of you meets Me with the testimony that there is no god\nexcept Allah and is sincere in it, then indeed He has entered My fort and\nwhoever enters My fort, he will be safe from My chastisement\u2019. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They asked, \u2018O son of Allah\u2019s Messenger (peace be on him and\nhis progeny)! And what is the sincerity of testimony for Allah?\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be on him) replied,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018Obedience of Allah and His Messenger (peace be on him and his\nprogeny) and to accept the mastership of his Ahle Bait (peace be on them)\u2019.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Notes:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This narration is\nHadis-e-Qudsi i.e. the word of Allah the Almighty which is not a part of the\nHoly Quran. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This particular\nnarration is also called as the narration of the Golden Chain (al-silsilah\nal-dhahab). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Al-Mamoon al-Abbasi\n(may Allah curse him) invited Imam Ali Ibn Moosa al-Reza (peace be on them) on\nthe pretext of honouring him. But his main aim was to keep the Imam (peace be\non him) under continuous government surveillance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this journey,\nal-Mamoon ensured that Imam al-Reza (peace be on him) does not pass through any\nShia city like al-Kufah and Qum al-Muqaddasah so that the Shias don\u2019t become\naware of this hideous conspiracy. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only Shia\ncities, al-Mamoon even tried that the Imam (peace be on him) should not be\nallowed to stop in any city of the general Muslims, lest he attracts them\ntowards the religion of the Ahle Bait (peace be on them). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, when Imam\n(peace be on him) reached Neshaapoor and did not make a halt anywhere, when he\n(peace be on him) reached to the last district of al-Marba\u2019ah, the Muslims\nstopped him and made a fervent appeal to him to narrate a tradition from his\ninfallible ancestors (peace be on them all). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In those days,\nNeshaapoor was having one of the most important centres of learning of the\nopponents of Shiaism. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Imam (peace be\non him) cited the importance of monotheism, they became delighted but when he\nunderlined that monotheism is not complete without the mastership of the Ahle\nBait (peace be on them), most of them became disappointed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Al-Amaali of\nal-Shaikh al-Toosi (r.a.), p. 588, H. 130 Majlis No.

\u201cI, Alqamah Ibn al-Hadhrami, Abu Hassaan\nal-Ejli and Abdullah Ibn Ajlaan were waiting for (Imam) Aba Ja\u2019far (al-Baqer)\n(peace be on him). He (peace be on him) came out to meet us and said, \u2018Greetings and welcome! By Allah, I love your fragrance and your\nspirits. Surely, you all are on the religion of Allah\u2019. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alqamah asked him (peace be on him), \u2018So whoever is on the\nreligion of Allah, will you testify for him that he is from the people of\nParadise?\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imam (peace be on him) paused for a while, then said, \u2018Examine yourselves. If you are not committing major sins, I will\ntestify\u2019. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We asked, \u2018And what are the major sins?\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be on him) informed, \u2018Associating\n(partners) with Allah the Great; eating the wealth of the orphans (unlawfully);\nadultery with a married woman; disobedience of parents and not being nice to\nthem; murder; usury and fleeing from the battlefield\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We said, \u2018None of us is afflicted with these sins\u2019. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be on him) reassured, <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018So, you are from the saved ones. Make this affair of yours\n(Shiaism) for Allah alone and don\u2019t make it for the people. For surely, whatever\nis for the people is for the people (i.e. its reward too should be expected\nfrom the people) and whatever is for Allah, it is for Him. Don\u2019t dispute with\nthe people with your religion because without doubt, disputing makes the heart\nill. Verily, Allah said to His Prophet (peace be on him and his progeny), \u2018You\ncannot guide whosoever you love\u2019 and He said, \u2018Are you forcing the people till\nthey become believers? \u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The\nMessenger of Allah (peace be on him and his progeny) stood up, kissed Ali\n(peace be on him) and hugged him tightly to his chest. Then, he (peace be on\nhim and his progeny) kissed al-Hasan (peace be on him) and made him sit on his\nright lap. After that, he (peace be on him and his progeny) kissed al-Husain\n(peace be on him) and made him sit on his left lap. Thereafter, he (peace be on\nhim and his progeny) started kissing the two and pecking their lips while\nsaying, <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018May my father be held ransom for your father and may my mother\nbe held ransom for your mother!\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, he (peace be on him and his progeny) said, <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018O people! Surely Allah \u2013 Purified and High be He \u2013 and all the\nangels take pride in both of them (al-Hasan and al-Husain), their father, their\nmother and the righteous ones from their offspring.\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, he (peace be on him and his progeny) prayed, <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018O Allah!

\u201cAllah and His Messenger (peace be on him and his\nprogeny) know the best.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imam (peace be on him) insisted, \u201cSay.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They said, \u201cPrayers, O son of Allah\u2019s Messenger.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be on him) replied, \u201cSurely,\nfor prayers there is an excellence but it is not prayers.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They said, \u201cPoor-rate.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, he (peace be on him) responded, \u201cSurely,\nfor poor-rate there is an excellence but it is not poor-rate.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They said, \u201cFasting of the month of Ramadhan.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be on him) argued, \u201cSurely,\nfor Ramadhan there is an excellence but it is not Ramadhan.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They said, \u201cThen it must be Hajj and Umrah.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be on him) refuted saying, \u201cSurely,\nfor Hajj and Umrah are excellent but it is not Hajj and Umrah.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They replied, \u201cFighting in the way of Allah.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be on him) rejected, \u201cSurely,\nfor fighting in the way of Allah there is an excellence but it is not fighting\nin the way of Allah.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They said, \u201cThen Allah and His Messenger (peace be on him\nand his progeny) know the best.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Imam (peace be on him) informed that the Messenger\nof Allah (peace be on him and his progeny) said, \u201cThe most\nreliable rope of faith is to love for Allah, to hate for Allah, to befriend the\nfriend of Allah and to bear enmity against the enemy of Allah.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Notes:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To fasten unto faith\nmeans to ensure that a person does not lose his faith under any circumstances\nand in the gravest of situations. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following four\nfactors are declared to be the most reliable rope of faith: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to love for Allah, <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to hate for Allah,

bear enmity against the enemy of Allah<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If somebody wants to\nsee the depth and steadfastness of his faith, he must see to the extent of his\nadherence to these four factors. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interestingly, these\nfour factors are regarded as more important than prayers, fasting, poor-rate,\nHajj and Umrah and fighting in the way of Allah.

Messenger of Allah (peace be on him and his progeny) addressed some of his companions thus, \u2018O servant of Allah! Love for the sake of Allah, hate for the sake of Allah, befriend for the sake of Allah and bear enmity for the sake of Allah because the Allah\u2019s guardianship cannot be obtained except through this. A person cannot taste the sweetness of faith even if his prayers and fasting are excessive till he is like this. Today, most of the brotherhood among the people is on account of this world.

There are several\nsuch traditions which speak about the importance of loving Allah, His\nemissaries and their friends. Likewise, they speak about the significance of\nhating the enemies of Allah, His emissaries and their friends (i.e. enemies of\nAllah\u2019s friends). In fact, when a narrator asked an infallible Imam (peace be\non him) about the importance of love and hatred in religion, he (peace be on\nhim) replied, \u2018Is religion anything but love and hatred?\u2019 (Tafseer al-Furaat,\np. 428 under the verse of Surah al-Hujuraat)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does this and other\nsuch traditions give a license to a person to sin and do whatever he wants?\nCertainly not. True Islam (viz. Shiaism) is a religion based on wisdom and\nlogic. Hence, when it talks about love, it means real love based on actions and\nnot mere lip service. Imams (peace be on them) have declared in no uncertain\nterms, \u201cWhoever is obedient to Allah, he is our follower and whoever is\ndisobedient to Allah, he is our enemy.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verses and\ntraditions that talk about Allah forgiving all the sins are indicative of\nAllah\u2019s all-encompassing mercy and compassion that encompasses the entire\ncreation. One must never despair of His clemency regardless of the magnitude of\nhis transgressions. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An imperative\nprerequisite for receiving divine forgiveness is the correctness of one\u2019s\nbeliefs concerning divine monotheism, divine justice, Prophethood, Imamate and\nthe Day of Resurrection. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the above\ntradition, an important condition is included: Love and enmity should not be on\npersonal gains or hatred\/malice. It should be sincerely in the way of Allah and\nthe Ahle Bait (peace be on them).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Al-Amaali of\nal-Shaikh

If you so wish I will leave you at this condition and your accounting\nis with Allah. And if you so desire, I will guarantee you Paradise from Allah\nand return to your original condition.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I said, \u2018I don\u2019t need to look at these inverted creatures.\nReturn

But utilising this right is not mandatory. The blood relative can either forgive or even demand blood money for it. There are many instances where a person might have been killed by someone but his blood relatives do not avenge the killing on personal, social or some other grounds and they prefer to be patient over taking revenge. Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) possessed extremely lofty morals and was personally trained by Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny). He was the most knowledgeable of the sensitive conditions of Muslims at that time and was also extremely aware of his concealed internal and external enemies. Hence, acting upon the covenant and the promise which he made to Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny), he chose not to rebel against the usurpers for the salvation of the Muslim society. He indicated towards this in the Sermon of Shiqshiqiyyah as well. The path he chose for the safety of Islam was the best proof of his rightfulness. <\/li><li>Solitary confinement, lack of supporters and assistance was another reason for his silence which he expressed in the same sermon of Shiqshiqiyyah. <\/li><li>Those who raise this objection and thereby try to deny the attack on the house of Hazrat Fatima Zahra (peace be upon her) should be asked: <ol><li>Why did Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) not take revenge from the killers of Hazrat Hamza, uncle of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny)? <\/li><li>Why did the companions not take revenge from those who attempted to kill the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) after the expedition of Tabuk? <\/li><li>Why did the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) grant respite to and not take revenge from Abu Sufyan, Muawiyah, Amr Aas and all other chiefs of the polytheists and disbelievers who were hostile towards the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his progeny) and Muslims, waged wars like Badr, Ohad, Khandaq, Khyber, etc. and martyred many Muslims?<\/li><li>Why was no revenge taken from Usmaan Bin Afaan who, as per the narrations of the Ahle Tasannun, killed Umm Kulsum, one of the daughters of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny)?<\/li><li>Does not seeking revenge mean these incidents didn\u2019t take place at all?<\/li><\/ol><\/li><li>Even if Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) wanted to take revenge then which court of law could he appeal to? History is witness that all the power was under the control and supervision of the rulers and they used to conveniently alter the cases as per their benefit. There are many such incidents. For example,<ol><li>Mughirah Ibn Sho\u2019bah committed adultery and there were witnesses against him but the witnesses were not accepted and instead they were flogged on the orders of the caliph.<\/li><li>Khalid Bin Waleed killed Maalik Ibn Nowairah and raped his wife but the caliph defended the actions of Khalid and on the contrary justified his actions.<\/li><\/ol><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These were only couple of examples where judgements were twisted in\nthe favour of the ones whom the rulers wanted to.

In fact, his hostility towards them, because of the heinous nature of the atrocities committed by them, is a well-known and documented fact. However, in order to conceal those crimes, the opponents of Shias often raise such baseless objections so that the masses do not believe in what actually transpired.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a concise reply with some proofs from the books of renowned Ahle Tasannun scholars who are considered to be among their extremely revered and reliable personalities in the field of Islamic history and traditions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Muslim Ibn Hajjaaj Neyshapoori writes: Umar, in the presence of Usman Ibn Affaan, Abd al-Rahmaan Ibn Awf, Zubair Ibn Awaam and Saad Ibn Abi Waqqaas, while addressing Abbas Ibn Abd al-Muttalib and Imam Ali (peace be upon him) said: \u201cWhen the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) passed away, Abu Bakr came to power and both of you considered him to be a liar, sinner, conspirer and a treacherous person. When Abu Bakr died and I became his successor, you considered me also, just like him, a liar, sinner, conspirer and treacherous.\u201d <a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Muhammad Ibn Ismail Bukhari writes on the authority of Ayesha: \u201cAli (peace be upon him) introduced Umar as a tyrannical and despotic person; he refused to meet Umar Ibn Khattaab and was extremely uncomfortable with the presence of Umar in a gathering.\u201d <a href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Umar Ibn Khattaab, on an expedition to Syria, told Abdullah Ibn Abbas about Imam Ali (peace be upon him): \u201cI have a complaint against your cousin. I requested him to accompany me to Syria but he refused. Your cousin seems to be forever uncomfortable with me. What could be the reason according to you?\u201d <a href=\"#_ftn3\">[3]<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Both Bukhaari and Muslim have recorded: \u201cHazrat Fatima (peace be upon her) was angry with Abu Bakr for this (usurpation of Fadak). She expressed her dissatisfaction with him and severed all contacts with him and did not speak to him till she left for her heavenly abode. When she departed from this world, her husband Ali (peace be upon him) buried her at night. He did not allow Abu Bakr (to be informed) about it and recited the funeral prayers himself.\u201d <a href=\"#_ftn4\">[4]<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>These are only few instances which are mentioned in the books of Ahle Tasannun which clearly establish that Imam Ali (peace be upon him) had severed his relations with the Shaikhain. Even after these, if someone tries to prove that he was on good terms with them, then he is either completely ignorant about history or has an ulterior motive to achieve some worldly or political gains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Few questions to those who claim that Imam Ali (peace be upon him) was on good terms with the Shaikhain:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If someone believes that they were liars, sinners, conspirers and treacherous, then will he continue to be on good terms with them?<\/li>\n<li>Why did Imam Ali (peace be upon him) refrain from meeting or even coming face-to-face with them and was discomforted even with their presence?<\/li>\n<li>Why did Imam Ali (peace be upon him) not participate in battles along with them?<\/li>\n<li>Why did Imam Ali (peace be upon him) bury Hazrat Fatima Zahra (peace be upon her) at night and did not inform them about her demise?<\/li>\n<li>Why did Hazrat Fatima Zahra (peace be upon her) express her displeasure and not speak to them till she left for her heavenly abode?<\/li>\n<li>Can calling them liars, sinners, conspirers and treacherous be considered as their praise and glorification?<\/li>\n<li>In one of his arguments, Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) labelled their actions as extremely sinful and also said that they deliberately opposed the orders of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny). <a href=\"#_ftn5\">[5]<\/a> Does this qualify as their praise?<\/li>\n<li>Whatever Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) has expressed in his sermon of Shiqshiqiyyah, will that also be regarded as their praise?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do the aforementioned narrations and proofs leave any further scope for a person to believe that Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) had cordial relations with those who oppressed Hazrat Fatima Zahra (peace be upon her)? While these were only few examples from Ahle Tasannun sources, there are a number of traditions and historical narrations in Shia sources to prove that Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) did not have even an iota of sympathy towards them, let alone things like paying allegiance to them or praying behind them.

With us (Ahle Bait\na.s.) are seventy-two (72) alphabets and one alphabet is with Allah which He has\nstored in the knowledge of the Unseen with Him.

Ibn Raashid reports, \u201cI heard Imam Abu Abdillah\nal-Sadeq (peace be upon him) say, <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA Jew came to the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) and stood in front\nof him, staring at him (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). He (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) asked, \u2018What do you want, O\nJew?\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He replied, \u2018Are you superior or Moosa Ibn Imran the Prophet\nwith whom Allah spoke, sent upon him the Torah and the staff, split the ocean\nfor him and shadowed him with a cloud?\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) replied, \u2018It is disliked that a\nperson praises his own self but I say that when (Prophet) Adam (peace be upon him) erred, he\nrepented with the following wordings, \u2018O Allah! Surely, I ask You for the sake\nof Muhammad and the progeny of Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) that You forgive me. So,\nAllah forgave him. Verily, when (Prophet) Noah (peace be upon him) boarded the ark and\nfeared drowning, he said, \u2018O Allah! Surely, I ask You for the sake of Muhammad\nand the progeny of Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) that You save me from drowning. So Allah\nsaved him it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Verily, when (Prophet) Ibraheem (peace be upon him) was thrown in the fire,\nhe said, \u2018O Allah! I ask You for the sake of Muhammad and the progeny of\nMuhammad (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) that You protect me from it, so Allah made it (the fire)\ncool and safe for him. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Verily, when (Prophet) Moosa (peace be upon him) threw his staff and experienced\nsome fear in himself, he said, \u2018O Allah! Surely I ask You for the sake of\nMuhammad and the progeny of Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) that You grant me safety. So\nAllah said, \u2018Don\u2019t fear. Surely, you will be dominant.\u2019 O Jew! Had Moosa (peace be upon him)\nfound me (i.e. been in my time) and not believed in me and my Prophethood, his\nbelief would not have benefitted him at all nor would have (his) Prophethood\nbenefitted him.\u2019 O Jew! From my progeny is the Mahdi. When he (a.t.f.s.)\nreappears, (Prophet) Eesaa Ibn Maryam (peace be upon him) will descend for his help and\nrequest him to lead the prayers and pray behind him (a.t.f.s.).\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Notes:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jew was wrong in\nclaiming that the staff descended on Prophet Moosa (peace be upon him) because as per our\ntraditions, it was given to Prophet Adam (peace be upon him) and thereafter, it was handed\nover from one Prophet (peace be upon him) to another in inheritance till it came to Prophet\nShoaib&nbsp; (peace be upon him) who gave it to his\nson-in-law Prophet Moosa (peace be upon him). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why the Holy Prophet\n(peace be upon him and his holy progeny) did not raise the objection in front of the Jew? The answer is\nsimple. The above question when compared to the issue of the mastership and\nsuperiority of the Ahle Bait (peace be upon them) is almost a non-issue. Hence, the Holy\nProphet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny), with his perfect and complete wisdom, thought it prudent to\nanswer the core issue rather than get entangled in peripheral matters. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, it is an\nabhorrent practice to indulge in self-praise. But sometimes, for the sake of\nsupporting truth and nullifying falsehood, it is not only not abominable but\neven recommended or obligatory to do so. Hence, we see that the Ahle Bait\n(peace be upon him) spoke about their lofty positions in order to introduce their divine\npersonalities for the people. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The divine Prophets\n(peace be upon him) mentioned in the above tradition are merely examples of the great\nProphets (peace be upon them). Otherwise, all the divine emissaries (peace be upon him), without\nexception, were inferior to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) and the\ninfallible guides from his progeny (peace be upon him). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we say that\nProphet Adam (peace be upon him) erred, we certainly don\u2019t believe that he committed a sin.\nIt is our firm belief that he (peace be upon him) simply left a preferable act, called as\nTark-e-aulaa in religious terminology. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding Imam Mahdi\n(a.t.f.s.) and Prophet Eesaa (peace be upon him), after the reappearance of Imam Mahdi\n(a.t.f.s.) when Prophet Eesaa (peace be upon him) also descends from the sky, there is not a\nsingle tradition from Shiite sources which says that Imam Mahdi (may Allah hasten his reappearance) will\noffer Prophet Eesaa (peace be upon him) to lead the prayers. For, it is not permissible for\na superior to ask an inferior to lead the prayers. But the opponents have recorded\nsuch narrations. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last but not the\nleast, when the great Prophets, Messengers and proximate angels of Allah (peace be upon him)\nwere in need of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) and his progeny (peace be upon him) for\nhelp, then what about us?

Now, let\u2019s see how this writer tries to justify this\ntradition. He writes, \u201cIt is said that the meaning of this narration is that\nwhen Ali (peace be upon him) emerged to fight, people exclaimed, \u2018There is no god but Allah,\nhow noble is this youth! There is no god but Allah, how knowledgeable\nis this youth! There is no god but Allah, how honorable is this youth!\nThere is no god but Allah, how pious is this youth! There is no god but\nAllah, how courageous is this youth! Since looking at Ali (peace be upon him) took\nthe people towards monotheism, hence looking at his face was considered as\nworship.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What he means to say that looking at Ali (peace be upon him) per se was\nnot worship but since it led the people to monotheism, looking at him was\nworship. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, this justification is baseless and absurd. For,\nwhen Ali (peace be upon him) came out on the battlefield, his valor was apparent is obvious.\nBut how his honor, knowledge, piety, etc. were known on the battlefield?&nbsp; For each trait there was a specific time and\nplace! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above mentioned narration from Ayesha, when Ali\n(peace be upon him) came to Abu Bakr, the latter did not utter any statement of monotheism.\nRather, he just kept staring at Ali (peace be upon him) and yet, justified his act by\nquoting the narration of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). So, who understood\nthe quote of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) more, Abu Bakr or the Banu Bakr?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One can easily deduce that the aim of Ibn al-Atheer was to\nsomehow reduce the significance of looking at Ali Ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon him) per se\nand connect the worship to statements of monotheism!! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, what about the other companions? Did looking at\ntheir faces lead the people into another direction instead of monotheism? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allah has set a seal upon their hearts, and on their ears\nand on their eyes is a covering!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Meah Manqebah, p. 151, Manqebah No. 84

None from the people judges with truth and justice\nexcept the key to that decree, its door, its beginning and its path is Ameerul\nMomineen Ali Ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon him).

<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018They believe in an\naffair (i.e. Imamate), then they break it and weaken it. They think that Allah\nhas completed His argument upon His creatures with a man but has hidden from\nhim the knowledge of the heavens and the earth. No, by Allah! No, by Allah! No,\nby Allah! (this is not so).\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked, \u2018Then what is\nthe reason for this incident between these devils and the issue of al-Husain\nIbn Ali (peace be upon him)? (If these divine proofs were so important, why Allah has\nallowed these devils (i.e. Bani Umayyah) to perpetrate the tragedy of\nAashuraa?)\u2019. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imam (peace be upon him) replied, <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018If they (viz. Imam\nHusain and his companions) would have prayed to Allah to prevent the incident\nof Aashuraa, He would have certainly answered their prayers and this was easier\nthan a thread, in which there\u2019s a bead, which breaks and the bead disappears.\nBut how would such a thing happen? For, we (Ahle Bait a.s.) don\u2019t intend except\nwhatever Allah intends\u2019.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behaar

(i.e. for\nseeking worldly favors), Habbaabah al-Waalebiyyah (r.a.) would visit Imam\nal-Husain (peace be upon him) (i.e. for seeking the Hereafter). She was a woman of intense\nstruggle. Her stomach skin had become dry to excessive worship. Once, she came\nout with her young paternal cousin. She brought him to Imam al-Husain (peace be upon him)\nand asked, \u2018May I be held your ransom! See, do you find this cousin of mine in\nwhat is with you (i.e. among your followers) and do you find him among the\nsaved ones?\u2019 He (peace be upon him) replied, \u2018Yes.

al-Momineen! Surely, I love you in private like I adore you in public.\u2019\nAsbagh says, \u2018Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) scratched in the earth with a piece of\nwood which he had in his hand for a while. Then, he (peace be upon him) raised his head and\nsaid, \u2018You are lying. By Allah! I do not recognize your\nface among the faces (of my lovers) and your name in the names (of the\nlovers).\u2019 Asbagh says, \u2018I was exceedingly amazed at this. I had barely\nsat for some more time when another person came and declared, \u2018O Ameer\nal-Momineen! By Allah! Surely, I love you in private like I adore you in\npublic.\u2019 Again, he (peace be upon him) scratched with that piece of wood in the earth for a\nlong time. Thereafter, he (peace be upon him) raised his head and said, <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018You have spoken the truth. Verily, our soil (teenat) is the\none which has Allah\u2019s mercy. Allah has taken its covenant on the day of the\ncovenant. Hence, none can come out from it nor can one enter it till the Day of\nJudgment\u2019.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behaar

He (peace be upon him) initiated the conversation with us\nand said,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018O Sulaiman! Whatever Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) has brought\nshould be acted upon and whatever he (peace be upon him) has prohibited should be refrained\nfrom. All the excellences that were present in the Messenger of Allah\n(peace be upon him and his holy progeny) were available in him (peace be upon him). For the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny)\nis superior to whosoever Allah has created. Whoever finds faults with Ameerul\nMomineen (peace be upon him) is like the one who finds faults with Allah and His Messenger\n(peace be upon him and his holy progeny). One who rejects him (peace be upon him) in anything \u2013 minor or major \u2013 has\nassociated partners with Allah. Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) was Allah\u2019s door as\nAllah cannot be approached but through him (peace be upon him). He (peace be upon him) was the path of\nAllah; if anybody tread a path other than his will be destroyed. The same\napplied for all the Imams (peace be upon them), one after the other. Allah has made them the\npillars of the earth that it should move due to them. They are the conveyed\nproofs for whoever is above the earth and inside its core. Ameerul Momineen\n(peace be upon him) declared, \u2018I am the distributor of Paradise and Hell on behalf of Allah.\nI am the greatest point of distinction (between truth and falsehood). I am the\nowner of the staff and the branding iron. All the angels and the Holy Spirit\nacknowledged me like they acknowledged the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny).\nIndeed I have been made to carry like Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) was made to carry and\nit is the burden of the Lord. Surely, Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) was called, clothed\nand made to speak. I too was called, clothed and made to speak. I speak like he\n(peace be upon him and his holy progeny) speaks. I have been characteristics which none before me has been\ngiven. I was taught the knowledge of deaths, calamities, genealogy and the\ndecisive statement. So there is no knowledge of the past that I have missed.\nThe knowledge of whatever is not in my presence is not concealed from me.

<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Muslims generally\nrespect anything remotely connected to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). But\nafter his martyrdom, the so-called companions came in numbers and burnt down\nthis very door, which was frequented by the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) as a mark of\nrespect to its inhabitants. And who were the inhabitants? Abd al-Kareem\nShahrastaani in Al-Melal wa al-Nehal writes, \u201cI swear by Allah! When they burnt\nthe door, there was none in it except Ali, Fatemah, Hasan and Husain (peace be upon him).\u201d\nThe same personalities for whom the second verse in the above tradition was\nrecited by the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worse than the sin\nis its justification! Some Muslims either deny the incident or justify it as an\nerror in jurisprudence! Take lesson, O people of wisdom!

The reason being that they don\u2019t ascend to Allah \u2013 Mighty and\nMajestic be He \u2013 with any deed by which He (viz.

Ibn Abi Talib a.s.), \u2018What is the sign of Imamate, may\nAllah have mercy on you?\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be upon him) told me, \u2018<em>Get\nme those pebbles<\/em>\u2019 and indicated towards some pebbles. I brought them to him\n(peace be upon him). He (peace be upon him) imprinted the seal of his ring on those pebbles for me and said,\n\u2018<em>O Habaabah! If a person claims Imamate, then if he can imprint on pebbles\nlike you saw, you should know that he is an Imam whose obedience is obligatory;\nnothing is hidden from an Imam when he intends something.\u2019 <\/em>I went\naway.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Ameerul Momineen\n(peace be upon him) departed from this world, I came to al-Hasan (peace be upon him) who was ensconced in\nthe seat of Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) and people were asking him questions. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be upon him) said, \u2018<em>O\nHabaabah!<\/em>\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I replied, \u2018Yes, O my\nmaster!\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018Give me what is with\nyou.\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I handed them (i.e.\nthe pebbles) to him and he (peace be upon him) imprinted the seal of his ring on them\nexactly like Ameerul Momineen (a.s) had done. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thereafter, I went to\nal-Husain (peace be upon him), who was in the Prophet\u2019s (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) mosque. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be upon him) came to me,\nwelcomed me and said to me, \u2018Surely, there is a proof in what you intend. Do\nyou want the proof of Imamate?\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I replied in the\naffirmative. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018Give me what is with\nyou.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I handed it over to\nhim and he (peace be upon him) printed the seal of his ring on it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, I approached Ali\nIbn al-Husain (peace be upon him) while I had become very old to the extent that I was\nquivering and my age was approximately 113 years. I saw him (peace be upon him) bowing,\nprostrating and busy in worship to the extent that I despaired from taking the\nproof from him (peace be upon him). But he (peace be upon him) indicated towards me with his index finger\nand my youth returned\u2026..<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Habaabah went on to\nlive till the time of the eighth Imam Ali Ibn Moosa al-Reza (peace be upon him), taking the\nproof of Imamate from each Imam (peace be upon him). After meeting al-Reza (peace be upon him) and taking\nthe proof of Imamate from him (peace be upon him), she died after nine months, according to\nMuhammad Ibn Heshaam.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2

upon him) and asked,\n\u2018May I be held your ransom! How is an Imam recognised?\u2019 He (peace be upon him) replied, \u2018<em>With\n(these) characteristics. The first one is that there should be something (a\nwill) from his father concerning him. He has introduced him to the people and\nappointed for them as a symbol so that he is a proof upon them because the\nMessenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) appointed Ali (peace be upon him) and introduced him to the\npeople. Similarly, all the Imams (peace be upon them) introduce them (their successors) to\nthe people and appoint them (the successors) for them (the people) so that they\n(the people) know them. When he is asked, he answers. When people are silent,\nhe initiates the conversation. He informs the people what will happen the next\nday. He speaks to them in all languages.<\/em>\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, he (peace be upon him) told me, \u2018O Aba Muhammad! In a minute,\nbefore you get up I will give you a sign by which you will become content\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Abu Baseer says) \u2018By Allah! While I was there, a person\nfrom Khorasan (in Iran) came to us and spoke in Arabic. But Imam (peace be upon him) replied\nto him in his native language (i.e. Persian). The Khorasani said, \u2018May Allah\nimprove your conditions! I did not speak in my native language because I\nthought you don\u2019t know it.\u2019 He (peace be upon him) retorted, \u2018<em>Glory be to Allah! If I am\nunable to answer you in your language, what is (the proof of) my superiority\nover you?\u2019 <\/em>Thereafter, he (peace be upon him) continued, \u2018<em>O Aba Muhammad! Nobody\u2019s\nspeech is hidden from the Imam; neither men nor birds nor beasts nor anything\nin which there is soul. An Imam is recognized through these traits. If these\ncharacteristics are not found in him, he is not an Imam\u2019.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Notes:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The salient features of this tradition is as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imam should have\nnass from the previous Prophet or Imam. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His knowledge should\nbe absolute and not limited and restricted to a field. Hence, he answers any\nquestion given to him.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When people are\nsilent, he initiates the conversation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He should have\nknowledge of the future (unseen). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He should be able to\nspeak all languages including that of animals, birds, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imam (peace be upon him) is\nsuperior to all in all aspects. No creature can be superior to Imam (peace be upon him) in\nany aspect. If the mamoom is superior to an Imam in any aspect \u2013 whether simple\nor complicated \u2013 the latter will cease to be an Imam.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2

This group is better than the first group.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet another group is\nbusy with understanding the apparent meaning of the Holy Quran. This group is\nbetter than the previous two groups. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the best group\nis the one who is busy in understanding the deeper meaning of the Holy Quran in\nthe light of the traditions of the Ahle Bait (peace be upon them).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visitation of Ahle\nBait (peace be upon him) means during their lives or even after their deaths to visit their\ngraves. Thus, it is a duty of every faithful to visit Madinah \u2013 in the least \u2013\nafter completing his Hajj or Umrah. This is a sign of his belief in the mastership\nof the Ahle Bait (peace be upon them).&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Al-Kaafi, vol.

If you were not included in\nthis verse (i.e. if this verse was not specific and it was general), Allah\u2019s\npunishment from His creatures would have dropped since no man or jinn would be\nquestioned about his sins.

al-Maasir. He said to his son, \u2018My son! Make\nme sit up\u2019. He made him sit up. He said, \u2018O People of Kufah! Surely, Abu\nHanifah and Ibn Qais al-Maasir (who was a Batri) came to me and said, \u2018You have\nnarrated traditions concerning Ali Ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon him), turn away from them\n(i.e. refute them) because repentance is accepted only till the soul is inside\nthe body (i.e. till a man is alive). So, I am saying to both of them, \u2018Persons\nlike you two are saying this to a person like me?\u2019 I hold you as witnesses, O\npeople of Kufah! I am in the last days of my worldly life and the first days of\nmy life of the Hereafter. Verily, I heard Ataa Ibn Rabaah say, \u2018I asked the\nMessenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) about the word of Allah \u2013 Mighty and Majestic be\nHe \u2013 \u2018<strong>Throw both of you in the hell every disbeliever, obstinate one<\/strong>\u2019.\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny), \u2018I and Ali will throw in the hell whoever\nbears enmity against us.\u2019 (On hearing this), Abu Hanifah said to Ibn Qais\nal-Maasir, \u2018Get up. Let\u2019s go.

(peace be upon him and his holy progeny) and said, \u2018O Messenger of\nAllah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny)! Accept my allegiance on Islam\u2019. He (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) replied, \u2018On\nthe condition that you will kill your father.\u2019 The Bedouin withdrew his hand\nand the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) started looking at the people, talking to\nthem. The Bedouin asked again, \u2018O Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny)! Accept my\nallegiance on Islam\u2019. He (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) replied, \u2018On the condition that you will\nkill your father.\u2019 The Bedouin replied in the affirmative and the Messenger of\nAllah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) accepted his allegiance that \u2018you will kill your father\u2019.&nbsp; Then the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) said,\n\u2018Now, you will not take any confidante other than Allah, His Messenger and the\nbelievers. Surely, I will not order you to disobey your parents but stay with\nthem in this world with kindness.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The above tradition (as also the verse with the same words)\nclearly says that once a person accepts Islam, he should not take anybody as\nconfidantes (\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0626\u062c) other than Allah,\nMessenger (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) and Imam (peace be upon him). That is, whenever there is a\ncontradiction between divine and devilish forces, a person should be very clear\nin his mind that he should opt for divine forces, notwithstanding his proximity\nor relation to the devilish forces. Hence, the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) has gone\nfor an extreme example of killing one\u2019s father. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A person\u2019s devotion and dedication to the cause of Imams\n(peace be upon him) should be like that of Malik Ashtar al-Nakhaee (r.a.). Ali (peace be upon him) said\nabout him, \u0644\u0642\u062f \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u064a \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0644\u0644\u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644 \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648 \u0622\u0644\u0647 \u0648 \u0633\u0644\u0645\n\u201cHe was unto me like I was to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny).\u201d (Rejaal Ibn\nDaawood, p. 283, No. 1232).

My\ncreatures that attract My attention is dearer to Me than the one who\nsupplicates for the sake of Muhammad and his Ahle Bait (peace be upon them). Verily, the\n\u201cwords\u201d which Adam (peace be upon him) received from his Lord, he said, \u2018O Allah! You are my\nMaster in my bounties, have power over my demands and know my needs, so I ask\nYou for the sake of Muhammad and the progeny of Muhammad that You have mercy on\nme and forgive my errors\u2019. So Allah revealed to him, \u2018O Adam! I am the Master\nof your bounty, have power your demands and know your needs; so why are you\nasking Me for the sake of these (personas)?\u2019 He replied, \u2018O Lord! When You blew\nyour spirit in me, I raised my head towards Your Throne, it was around it,\n\u2018There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.\u2019 So I was sure\nthat he (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) is the noblest of Your creation near You. Thereafter, You\npresented to me the Names; those that passed by My right side were the progeny\nof Muhammad and their followers, by which I was sure that they are the closest\nof Your creatures to You\u2019.

What amazes me a lot about some people who don\u2019t\naccept your mastership and submit to the mastership of so and so. They are\ntrustworthy, truthful and loyal. But those who accept your mastership don\u2019t\nhave these traits trustworthiness, loyal and truthfulness.\u201d (On hearing this\nquestion), Imam Abu Abdillah (peace be upon him) sat up straight, looked at me like an angry\nperson and said, \u2018There is no religion for the one who does\nnot believe in an unjust Imam not appointed by Allah and the one who believes\nin a just Imam appointed by Allah will not have any reproach.\u2019 I asked\n(in astonishment), \u2018The first group does not have religion and the second no\nblame?\u2019 He (peace be upon him) retorted, \u2018Have you not heard the word of\nAllah \u2013 Might and Majestic be He \u2013 Allah is the Patron\nof those who believe; He takes them out from darkness to light\u2019? That is, from the darkness of sins to the light of repentance\nor forgiveness for their (acceptance of) mastership of a just Imam appointed by\nAllah. He says, \u2018And those who disbelieved, their\nmasters are the devils who bring them out from light to darkness.\u2019 Then what is the light that was for the disbeliever then he\nbrings him out of it? He only means by this that surely they were on the light\nof Islam. When they have accepted every unjust Imam who is not appointed by\nAllah they come out from this mastership of theirs to the darkness of\ndisbelief. Hence, Allah made the hell-fire obligatory upon them along with the\nunbelievers. He says, \u2018These are the inmates of the\nhell-fire. They shall stay in it forever.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Abdullah Ibn Abi Yafoor (r.a.) was a great companion of the\nImam Sadiq (peace be upon him). He was oppressed like most of Allah\u2019s friends. He was\nregarded among the hawaari of the 6th Imam (peace be upon him). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The opponents are totally deviated on all issues, mainly\nbeliefs. The reason being that they have abandoned their Imam (peace be upon him). Hence,\nImam (peace be upon him) says that they don\u2019t have ANY RELIGION at all whatsoever. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the Imam is not from Allah, he will be an ordinary human.\nNaturally, such a person will always be prone to mistake in most of the fields.\nIn case of spirituality, it will lead to eternal perdition. One who is not\nconnected to Allah will inevitably be unjust because he will not put a thing in\nits place. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imam (peace be upon him) has used the term \u2018infidel\u2019 for the opponents. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taaghoot is an exaggerative noun for tughyaan. Satan is\ntaaghoot. A tyrant ruler is taaghoot. A bogus Imam is taaghoot. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here a question may arise. An opponent who doesn\u2019t know\nanything about the historical disputes, will he still be subjected to eternal\npunishment? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reply<\/strong>: Deviated people are of 3 kinds:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The one who knows,\nis well aware and yet he denies.

purification reports on the authority of Umm Salmah\n\u2013 one of the best wives of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) after Hazrat Khadijah\n(peace be upon her) \u2013 from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) who said to Fatima (peace be upon her), \u201cBring to me your husband and your two sons.\u201d She brought\nthem. He (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) put a cloak on them. Thereafter, he (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) put his hand\nabove them and invoked, \u201cO Allah! These are the progeny of\nMuhammad. So put Your salutations and blessings upon the progeny of Muhammad.\nSurely, You are the Praiseworthy, the Majestic.\u201d She (Umm Salmah) says,\n\u201cI raised the cloak so that I could be with them.\u201d He (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) put me away\nsaying, \u2018Surely, you are on goodness (but not deserving to\nbe in this cloak\u2019.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This narration is called as the Hadis al-Kisaa. The reason\nfor putting the cloak was to bring in exclusivity, so that none else in the\nhouse could claim being one of them. Remember, Umm Salmah (r.a.) was greater in\nposition than an ordinary just and righteous person. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in its exclusive meaning it implies the fourteen\ninfallible guides (peace be upon him) including the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another point is that the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) said, \u201c\u2026<em>upon\nAale Muhammad<\/em>\u201d when he (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) could have said \u201c\u2026upon them\u2019.

that\nwhoever dies on the love of the progeny of Muhammad dies a repentant one; know\nthat whoever dies on the love of the progeny of Muhammad dies a believer whose\nfaith is complete; know that whoever dies on the love of the progeny of\nMuhammad the angel of death will give him glad-tidings of paradise, followed by\nMunkar and Nakeer (in giving glad-tidings); know that whoever dies on the love\nof the progeny of Muhammad he will be carried to Paradise like a bride is\ncarried to the house of her groom; know that whoever dies on the love of the\nprogeny of Muhammad two doors to Paradise are opened for him in his grave; know\nthat whoever dies on the love of the progeny of Muhammad Allah will make his\ngrave as a place of visitation for the angels of mercy; and know that whoever\ndies on the love of the progeny of Muhammad dies on the Sunnah and the Jam\u2019ah;\nknow that whoever dies on the hatred of the progeny of Muhammad will come on\nthe Day of Judgment while it is written on his forehead \u2018He has despaired from\nthe mercy of Allah\u2019; know that whoever dies on the hatred of the progeny of\nMuhammad dies an unbeliever; know that whoever dies on the hatred of the\nprogeny of Muhammad will not even smell the fragrance of Paradise.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand the meaning of the above narration, one must\nread the importance of a martyr in the books of traditions, like Baab Fazl\nal-Shahaadah in Kaafi. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His faith will become perfect in one flash, even if he was\nnot having proper faith. Obviously, such narrations are difficult to digest but\nthey are as they are. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zaffa \u2013 yazuffu means the angels will take him in\ncongregation with a lot of care. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunnah implies the word, act or silence of infallible guides\n(peace be upon him). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Human co-operation, congregation and large numbers help only\nin wordly matters but not in divine affairs. If all humans gather together on a\nfalse matter, will it be correct? No. In Islam, the criterion for consensus is\ntruth. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behaar al-Anwaar,\nvol. 23, p. 233

upon him and his holy progeny)\ncame to Madinah and Islam became strong, the Ansar said among themselves, \u2018When\nthe Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) comes we will say, \u2018Affairs (of Islam like\nbattles) have put you in hardships. This is our wealth. You can use it as you\nwill without any restriction and prohibition upon you\u2019. They came with this\nintention. At this point, the verse, \u2018Say: I don\u2019t ask you for\nany reward but that you love my closest relatives\u2019 was revealed. He\n(peace be upon him and his holy progeny) recited it for them and said, \u2018Love my relatives\nafter me.\u2019 They went away submitting to his advice. The hypocrites\ninsinuated, \u2018This is a lie which he has forged in his gathering. By this, he\nintends to subjugate us before his relatives after him.\u2019 Immediately, the\nfollowing verse was revealed, \u2018Or are they saying that he has\nforged a lie against Allah?\u2019 He (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) called for them and recited\nfor them the verse. They cried. He (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) became even more severe upon\nthem. At which, the verse, \u2018And He is the One Who accepts the\nrepentance from His servants\u2026 (Till the end of the verse)\u2019 was revealed,\ndue to which, he (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) sent for them and gave them glad-tidings. \u2018And He answers those who believe\u2026\u2019 and these were those who\nhad submitted to his word. Thereafter, Allah the High said, \u2018Whoever\nearns a good deed, We will increase for him in it a goodness\u2026\u201d yes, whoever does an act of obedience, we will increase for him\nin this act of obedience a goodness i.e. We will make him eligible for reward.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note: <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the important prerequisites of love is obedience.\nHadis says, \u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0628 \u0644\u0645\u0646 \u064a\u062d\u0628 \u0645\u0637\u064a\u0639 \u2018<em>Surely the lover obeys the one whom he\nloves\u2019<\/em>.

So, I am its root, Ali is its\nbranch, Hasan and Husain are its fruits and our Shiites are its leaves. Whoever\nfastens unto any of its branches will be saved and whoever deviates will be\ndeviated. If a person worships Allah between Safaa and Marwah for a thousand\nyears, then again a thousand years, till he becomes like a worn-out skin but\ndoes not love us, Allah will throw him on his face in the hell-fire.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, he (peace be upon him) recited the verse of Surah Shura.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>The above tradition shows\nthat Ali (peace be upon him) was not from the companions, narrators, students, etc. of the\nHoly Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny), although all these traits fitted him.

Inform me what the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny)\nhas willed unto you.\u201d He (peace be upon him) said, <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSoon I shall inform you. Surely, Allah chose for you the\nreligion and selected it and completed His bounties upon you while you were\ndeserving it and worthy of it. Verily, Allah revealed to His Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny)\nthat he (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) should will unto me. So the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) said, \u2018O Ali!\nPreserve my will, observe my agreements, fulfil my promises, repay my loans,\nenliven my Sunnah and call towards my religion. For, Allah \u2013 the High \u2013 chose\nme and selected me. So, I remembered the prayer of my brother (Prophet) Moosa\n(peace be upon him) and I said, \u2018O Allah! Appoint for me a minister from my family\u2019 like you\nappoint Haroon for Moosa. Allah \u2013 Mighty and Majestic be He \u2013 revealed to me,\n\u2018Surely, Ali is your minister, your helper and your Caliph after you.\u2019 Then, O\nAli, you are from the Imams of guidance and your descendants are from you. So\nall of you are the leaders of guidance and piety and the tree, whose root I am\nand you are its branch. So whoever fastens unto it (the tree), then indeed he\nwill be saved and whoever lags behind, then indeed he will be destroyed and\nperished. You are those whose love and mastership Allah \u2013 the High \u2013 has made\nobligatory and Allah has remembered him in His Book and described them for His\nservants. So, Allah \u2013 Mighty and Majestic be He \u2013 said, \u2018Surely\nAllah chose Adam, Noah, the progeny of Abraham and the progeny of Imran upon\nthe worlds; (they are) descendants of each other. And Allah is the All-Hearing,\nthe All-Knowing.\u2019 You are the chosen ones of Allah from Adam, Noah, the\nprogeny of Abraham and the progeny of Imran. You are the family of Ismaaeel and\nthe guiding progeny from Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy progeny)\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The above tradition is important and its importance\nincreases due to its narrator being Ibn Abbas. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The people in general and the Muslims in particular get\ntheir lineage from their fathers and not mothers. For example, if a person\u2019s\nfather is from Baghdad and his mother is from Basra, he will called as Baghdadi\nand not Basri. But in the case of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny), Allah has\nmade an exception. Of course, Imam Hasan and Husain (peace be upon him) were the sons of Ali\n(peace be upon him) but here, Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) have made an exception that\nthey are also called as the sons of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a difference between guidance and piety. A person\nmay be guided but may not be pious. Imams (peace be upon them) lead the people towards both. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, there is a difference between \u0647\u0644\u0643 and \u0647\u0648\u064a. Halaka means\ndestroyed and Hawaa means collapse. Destruction in this world, Barzakh and the\nhereafter. But collapse means punishment. Sometimes destruction may be without\npunishment. For example, a person meets with a car accident and is killed. But\nthis is not punishment because it is not his fault. But hawaa means destruction\nwith punishment. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the storm of Prophet Noah (peace be upon him) came, only those who\nboarded the ark were saved and others were destroyed.

when a man told him, \u201cYou interpret the Book of Allah\nwhat you have not heard.\u201d Imam Abu al-Hasan (peace be upon him) replied, <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt was revealed upon us before the people. It was interpreted\nfor us before its interpretation among the people. So, we know the verses\nconcerning the permissible and prohibited, its abrogating and abrogated verses,\nthose which were revealed during the stay in cities and those during the\njourneys, in which night how many verses were revealed, about whom it was\nrevealed and about what it was revealed. We are Allah\u2019s sages in His earth, His\nwitnesses on His creatures and this is the word of Allah, \u2018Soon\ntheir testimonies shall be written and they will be asked\u2019. So the\ntestimonies are for us and the questioning is against whom we testify. This is\nthe knowledge that I am conveying to you and transferring to you whatever was\nbinding on me. If you accept, then be thankful and if you abandon, then surely\nAllah is having power over all things.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The man tries to imply that the knowledge of the Imam (peace be upon him)\nis like that of the ordinary people.

Muhammad al-Baqer (peace be upon him), <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cVerily, the Messenger of\nAllah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) was the most superior of those firmly entrenched in knowledge.\nIndeed, he (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) knew all what Allah sent down upon him from the descent\nand the interpretation. It does not behove Allah that He sends down something\nupon him but does not teach him its interpretation. The successors after him\nknow it in its entirety.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked, \u201cMay I be held\nyour ransom! Surely, Aba al-Khattaab used to say about you a great thing!\u201d He\n(peace be upon him) asked, \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d I replied, \u201cHe said that you have the knowledge\nof the permissible and the prohibited and the Quran.\u201d He (peace be upon him) retorted, <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe knowledge of the\npermissible and the prohibited and the Quran is insignificant in front of the\nknowledge which occurs day and night.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThose firmly entrenched in knowledge\u201d\nimplies those who have the knowledge of the unseen and their knowledge is free\nof faults and deficiencies. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is worth paying attention that according to the Holy\nQuran itself, \u201cThere is not a wet thing nor a dry thing but\nthat it is in the Open Book.\u201d It comprises of all the knowledge. Its\napparent indicates about some things and its concealed conveys others.

Imam Abu Abdillah al-Sadeq (peace be upon him) and asked him a question. He\n(peace be upon him) gave me a reply. I was sitting when another man entered and asked\nexactly the same question. Imam (peace be upon him) replied contrary to what he (peace be upon him)\nreplied to me. Then, yet another man entered and asked precisely the same\nquestion. Now, Imam (peace be upon him) replied other than what he (peace be upon him) replied to me and\nthe second person. I got frightened because of this and it was difficult for me\nto bear. When the people dispersed, he (peace be upon him) looked at me and said, \u2018<em>O son\nof Ashyam! It seems you are restless<\/em>.\u2019 I replied, \u2018May I be held your\nransom! I am restless due to the three (different) replies to one question\u2019. He\n(peace be upon him) retorted, \u2018<em>O son of Ashyam! Surely Allah delegated to Prophet Dawood\nthe affairs of His kingdom and said, \u2018<\/em><strong>This is our grant. So, spend or\nwithhold without reckoning.<\/strong><em>\u2019 And He delegated to Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) the\naffair of His religion and said, \u2018<\/em><strong>Whatever the Messenger gives you, take\nit and from whatever He restrains you, abstain from it<\/strong><em>.\u2019 Verily, Allah\nhas delegated to the Imams (peace be upon them) from us and unto us whatever He has delegated\nunto Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). Hence, don\u2019t be impatient\u2019<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Shariah laws are many and of various types. For example,\nablutions for obligatory prayers is obligatory at the least. But if there is\nany excuse, then the ablutions will become prohibited and should be replaced\nwith <em>tayammum<\/em>. Since the infallible Imams (peace be upon them) are having knowledge of\nthe unseen, they guide the people accordingly. Sometimes, they say perform\nablutions and at other times, they say do tayammum. For some in the gathering,\nthey see the apparent contradiction and get confused. Imam (peace be upon him) has judged\nonly for the facilitation for the questioner. Another thing is that many\ntraditions have come that Allah trained His Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny); when the\nProphet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) was trained, Allah handed over the religion to him. Now, he\nhas the power to relate the branches of Islam. Just like a professor at the\nuniversity explains the basic laws and gives different problems to students to\nsolve. Now many laws have been formulated by the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). For example,\nearlier all the daily prayers were two units each but the Greatest Prophet\n(peace be upon him and his holy progeny) has increased some of them; noon and night prayers to four each and\ndusk to three. The Imams (peace be upon them) have this power to execute their legislative\nmastership. Thus, the Imams (peace be upon them) used to reply questioners of the same\nquestion with different answers, which were apparently contradictory to the\nna\u00efve.<strong><em><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behaar al-Anwaar,\nvol. 23, p. 185, H. 52

\u201c<strong>Ask the people of remembrance if you are not knowing<\/strong>.\u201d Who\nare implied by this? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be upon him) replied, \u201cWe.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I inquired, \u201cSo you are the ones who should be asked?\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be upon him) replied, \u201cYes.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked, \u201cAnd we are the questioners?\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, he (peace be upon him) replied in the affirmative. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I questioned, \u201cSo, is it obligatory upon us to ask you?\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be upon him) said, \u201cYes.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked, \u201cIs it compulsory upon you to reply to us (our\nquestion)?\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be upon him) responded, \u201cNo. This is up to\nus. If we please, we will reply and if we please, we will leave it.\u201d\nThen he (peace be upon him) recited the following verse, \u2018This is our\ngrant. So, give or withhold without any account\u2019.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, the word remembrance is used in its first meaning viz.\nthe Holy Quran. The people of Quran are those whose knowledge of Quran is\ncomplete, not based on whims and views which are certainly prone to errors.\nThus, they should know the whole Quran, not part of it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last sentence is important. It is not necessary for the\nImams (peace be upon them) to answer all questions. Allah has given them the Quran in its\nentirety. He has made it obligatory for the people to question but it\u2019s not\nnecessary for them (peace be upon him) to reply. They (peace be upon him) will see if it is ok to reply,\nthey will do so; not otherwise. (Here, the example of giving money to Jaabir\nand Kumait can be given). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imam (peace be upon him) quotes the verse from Quran about Prophet\nSulaiman (peace be upon him). When for a lowly thing like worldly bounties, Allah has given\nthe authority to Sulaiman to exercise his choice, then for a spiritual bounty\nlike knowledge, Allah will not give the Ahle Bait (peace be upon them) authority?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behaar al-Anwaar, vol. 23, p. 174, H. 3 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Is this possible? In this case, they will call\nus towards their religion and they will say that it (their religion) is\nsuperior to Islam.<\/em>\u201d At this Mamoon interrupted, \u201cDo you have any\nexplanation contrary to what they are saying, O Aba al-Hasan?\u201d He (peace be upon him)\nanswered, \u201c<em>Yes. Remembrance (<\/em>\u0630\u0643\u0631<em>) implies the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny)\nand we are his family (<\/em>\u0627\u0647\u0644<em>). This is explained in the Book of Allah \u2013\nMighty and Majestic be He \u2013 when He says in Surah Talaq <\/em>\u2018<strong>So fear Allah, O people of intellect, those\nwho believed; indeed Allah has sent upon you a remembrance, a messenger who\nrecites for you the clear verses of Allah<\/strong>\u2019. <em>Thus, remembrance is the\nMessenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) and we are his family.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost all or at least\nmost of the scholars of Ahl Tasannun suggest that people of remembrance (\u0627\u0647\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0643\u0631)\nmeans people of the book (\u0627\u0647\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628) viz. the Jews and the Christians. Here,\nImam (peace be upon him) is using this verse as a proof of the superiority of the Ahle Bait\n(peace be upon him). Thus, they are the most superior and hence, it is the duty of the\nentire nation to submit to them. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGlory be to Allah\u201d in\nits secondary meaning is used for expressing amazement (\u0643\u0644\u0645\u0629 \u062a\u0639\u062c\u0628). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you ask the Jews\nand the Christians what is right and what is wrong?

\u2013 Mighty and\nMajestic be He \u2013 Ya Seen and the Wise Quran. Surely,\nyou are from the Messengers upon the right path.\u2019\nWhom did He imply by His word Ya Seen?\u201d The scholars replied, \u201cYa Seen is Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy progeny).

So He \u2013 blessed and High be He \u2013\nsaid, \u2018Salutations be on Noah in the worlds\u2019 and He said, \u2018Salutations be on\nIbraheem\u2019 and He said, \u2018Salutations be on Moosa and Haroon\u2019 but He did not say\n\u2018Salutations be on the progeny of Noah\u2019.

In the physical presence of infallible Imams (peace be upon them), it is prohibited to use one\u2019s own jurisprudence. For example, Umar Ibn al-Khattaab issued an edict for the prohibition of temporary marriage (<em>mut\u2019ah al-nisaa<\/em>) and <em>Hajj tamattu<\/em>, which were permissible during the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). He even took pride in defying this order of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) by saying, \u2018There were two mut\u2019ahs that were permissible during the time of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) but I prohibited them\u2019.

holy progeny) said, \u201cFasten unto the\nbelt of this man with a broad forehead viz. Ali (peace be upon him). For, he is the most\ntruthful person and he is the distinguisher who distinguishes between truth and\nfalsehood. Whoever loves him Allah guides him and whoever bears malice against\nhim Allah bears malice against him. Whoever lags behind him Allah will destroy\nhim. From him are the two grandsons of my nation, al-Hasan and al-Husain and\nthey are my two sons. From Husain (peace be upon him) are the Imams of guidance. Allah has\ngranted them my knowledge and my understanding. So accept their mastership and\ndon\u2019t take any confidante other than them lest the wrath of your Lord befalls\nyou. And on whosoever the wrath of his Lord befalls indeed he is destroyed. And\nwhat is this worldly life except the provision of deception?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Truthfulness does not depend only on one\u2019s words. Rather, it\nalso depends on one\u2019s deeds. For example, a person claims to be a Muslim but\ndoes not pray then he is not a truthful person. He is a hypocrite. So, Ali\n(peace be upon him) was truthful but not only in words but deeds as well and he was the\ngreatest in this regard. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Faarooq means who distinguishes excessively between truth\nand falsehood. Ali (peace be upon him) was at this level especially because he was having\nthe knowledge of the unseen due to which he could easily distinguish between\ntruth and falsehood. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reward and punishment are in this world, barzakh, a\u2019raaf and\nhereafter (paradise and hell). One of the rewards for Ali\u2019s love is guidance in\nthis world. And the punishment for bearing enmity against Ali is that Allah\nbears enmity against him. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>None is allowed to enter the system of Imamah except through\nthese twelve Imams (peace be upon them). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The enjoyments of this world are nothing except deception.\nWhat is the connection of this last sentence with the previous statements of\nthe tradition? It means that don\u2019t allow the world to deceive you against the\nImams (peace be upon them) for the sake of few days enjoyment of this deceptive world. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there any difference between knowledge and understanding?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes.

Abbas chronicles that\nthe Messsenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) said to Ali Ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon him),<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cO Ali! I am the city of\nwisdom and you are its gate. The city is not approached but from its gate. He\nhas lied who thinks that he loves me but hates you because you are from me and\nI am from you. Your flesh is my flesh and your blood is my blood. Your soul is\nmy soul, your secret is my secret and your apparent is my apparent. You are the\nImam of my nation and my Caliph upon it after me. Fortunate is he who obeys you\nand wretched is he who disobeys you. Winner is he who accepts your mastership\nand loser is he who bears enmity against you. Successful is he who fastens unto\nyou and destroyed is the one who separates from you. Your likeness and the\nlikeness of the Imams (peace be upon them) from your progeny after me is like that of the Ark\nof Noah. Whoever boards it will be saved and whoever lags behind will drown.\nThe likeness of you Imams (peace be upon them) is that of the stars; whenever one star\ndisappears another star appears (and this shall continue) till the Day of\nJudgment.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above tradition,\nthe word \u2018wisdom\u2019 (\u062d\u0643\u0645\u0629) is neither in the meaning of medicine nor\nphilosophy. Rather, one of meanings is to \u2018put a thing in its place\u2019 in this\nworld as well as the hereafter including its worlds like the Barzakh, the\nA\u2019raaf, the Heaven and the Hell. Thus, wisdom cannot be found in any other\nplace except here viz. the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) and Ameerul Momineen\n(peace be upon him). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<em>You are from me\nand I am from you\u201d<\/em> is the same concept as propounded in the Verse of\nMaledictioon (<em>Mubaahelah<\/em>). This being from the same self is not\nrestricted to any one aspect of the personality. Rather, it talks about all its\naspects. Thus, apparently there are two bodies but the original existence\n(light and self) is one reality. There are many references for this fact. \u201cI\nand Ali from the same light\u201d. Till Abdul Muttalib they were in one loin.\nThereafter, this light was split into Abdullah and Abu Talib (peace be on them\nboth). There should be no astonishment at such traditions. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018<em>Successful is he who\nfastens unto you and destroyed is the one who separates from you<\/em>\u2019 also\ngrades. The level of Salman\u2019s success was different from that of Abuzar. The\nsame applies for destruction. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The series of guides\nwill continue till the Day of Judgment. Imam Mahdi (may Allah hasten his reappearance) is the last of\nthem. Today, like in the times of previous Imams (peace be upon them), it is the duty of the\npeople to contact their Imam (peace be upon him). For example, Ali (peace be upon him) did not contact\nSalman. The latter contacted Ali (peace be upon him) and obeyed his instructions. But today,\nit is he (a.t.f.s.) who visits whosoever he wishes. Thus, in reality, it is not\noccultation but manifestation with all its intensity. Imam (may Allah hasten his reappearance) will\nappear for the general masses at the time of reappearance.

He spoke only what was revealed to\nhim (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). Revelation was sometimes terminological like the Holy Quran and\nsometimes it was not part of the Noble Quran; rather, it was Hadis Qudsi and\nsometimes it was his saying and part of his Sunnah.

But they did not show such faith in\nAli (peace be upon him) even apparently because of their jealousy and hatred towards him.\nTheir words and actions prove this fact as they believe that his predecessors\nwere superior to Ali (peace be upon him)!! Therefore, if the Imams (peace be upon them) are attributed to\nthe daughter of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny), at least they will show some\napparent respect for the Imams

He reports, \u201cI went to Imam Sajjad (peace be upon him) and inquired about his opinion concerning this book. At that moment, Abu al-Tufail Aamir Ibn Waathelah \u2013 a companion of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) and a very good companion of Ali (peace be upon him) \u2013 was sitting with him (peace be upon him). There, I also met Umar Ibn Abi Salamah, the son of Umm Salamah the wife of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). [Umm Salamah before her marriage to the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) was married to a man called Abu Salamah, from whom she had a son called Umar. This Umar was a nice man and was trained and brought up in the house of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny)].<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I presented to him (peace be upon him) the Book of Sulaim. Imam (peace be upon him) said, \u201cSulaim \u2013 may Allah have mercy on him \u2013has spoken the truth.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I said, \u201cMay I be held your ransom! Some concepts in it straiten my heart. For, in it is the destruction of the nation of Muhamamd (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) including the top Muhajireen, Ansar and the Taabeen except you Ahle Bait (peace be upon him) and your Shiites.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imam (peace be upon him) replied, \u201cO brother of Abd al-Qais! Have you not heard that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) said, \u2018Surely, the likeness of my Ahle Bait is like that of the Ark of Noah in his nation? Whoever boards it will be saved and whoever is left behind will be drowned and the likeness of the door of Hettah in the Bani Israel?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I replied in the affirmative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be upon him) asked, \u201cWho has narrated to you?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I answered that I have heard it from more than hundred learned scholars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be upon him) inquired again, \u201cLike whom?\u201d (i.e. give some examples)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I said, \u201cI have heard it from Hubaish (or Hanash) Ibn al-Motamir and he mentioned that he had heard it from Abuzar while he was holding the latch of the door of the Kabah calling out loudly that he had heard it from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny).\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imam (peace be upon him) asked, \u201cAnd from who else?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I answered, \u201cAl-Hasan Ibn Abi al-Hasan al-Basri who heard it from Abuzar and from Miqdad Ibn Aswad and Ali Ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon him).\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Al-Hasan al-Basri was an erratic (\u0645\u062a\u0642\u0644\u0628\u0629) personality. There is a personality that is unstable (\u0642\u0644\u0642\u0629) and there is an erratic one. The latter stems from natural short-coming (\u0642\u0635\u0648\u0631) while the former is due to one\u2019s weakness in faith (\u062a\u0642\u0635\u064a\u0631). The latter needs someone to guide him, otherwise he gets swayed by anyone. But the former is like a chameleon who changes his colour as per his convenience and material\/worldly benefits. Al-Hasan al-Basri initially was among the supporters of Ali (peace be upon him) but later, became the backer of the Umayyads like Marwan and his governor Hajjaj Ibn Yusuf (l.a.). He openly voiced his support for both these tyrants. So much so that it is said, \u201cBut for the sword of Hajjaj and the tongue of al-Hasan al-Basri, the government of Marwan couldn\u2019t have stabilized (\u0644\u0648 \u0644\u0627 \u0633\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062c\u0627\u062c \u0648 \u0644\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0635\u0631\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u0642\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0648\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0646\u064a).\u201d Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) had even called him as the Saamari of this nation. Al-Hasan al-Basri has narrated the above narration during his period in truth).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be upon him) asked, \u201cFrom who else?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I replied, \u201cFrom Saeed Ibn al-Musayyeb, Alqamah Ibn Qais, Abu Zabyaan al-Janbi (al-Janb was an Arabian family) and Abd al-Rahman Ibn Abi Lailaa, all of whom reported that they heard from Abuzar.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this, Abu al-Tufail and Umar Ibn Abi Salamah intervened, \u201cBy Allah! We have also heard it from Abuzar and we have also heard it from Ali (peace be upon him), Miqdad and Salman.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thereafter, Umar Ibn Abi Salamah turned towards me and said, \u201cI have heard it from the one who is superior to all of these. I heard it from the Messsenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). I heard him (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) when he said loudly and my heart retained it.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then Imam Ali Ibn al-Husain (peace be upon him) turned towards me and asked,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIs this narration alone not enough to pacify all that bothers you and is great in your heart than all these (other) narrations (recorded in the Book of Sulaim)? Fear Allah! O Brother of Abd al-Qais, if a matter is clear for you, accept it and if not, keep quiet, you will be safe and refer its knowledge to Allah because with you (is the license to leave the matter due to ignorance) is whatever is vaster than the heavens and the earth.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Abd al-Qais is the name of the narrator\u2019s family. If the matter is clear, then accept it. That is, even if the whole world is against you like about Prophet Ibraheem (peace be upon him) the Noble Quran says he was a single nation (\u0623\u0645\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f\u0629).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reference:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Behaar al-Anwaar, vol. 23, p. 124, H.

thereafter, he leant his back towards it\n(i.e. Kabah) and addressed (the people) thus, \u201cO People! Whoever knows me then\nindeed he knows me and whoever does not know me, then I am Abuzar. I heard the\nMessenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) say, <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018The likeness of my Ahle Bait (peace be upon them) in this nation is like the\nArk of Noah (peace be upon him). Whoever boards it will be saved and whoever leaves it will\nbe destroyed.\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) say, <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018Make my Ahle Bait (peace be upon them) to you like the head is to the body\nand the eyes are to the head. Surely, the body cannot be guided without the\nhead and the head cannot be guided without the eyes.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Raafe\u2019 the narrator of this narration is the slave of\nAbuzar. When Abuzar says, \u2018I am Abuzar\u2019, he was implying that I am no ordinary\nperson; I am speaking the truth and Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) has testified for\nthis. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As is well-known, Abuzar was openly criticizing the rulers\nafter the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny).

When man walks, true that he walks with his legs\nand when he buys something, he does it so with his hands. But in all this\nprocess, you look at his face and while talking with him, you look at this\neyes. This narration shows that guidance is not possible without the Ahle Bait\n(peace be upon him).

the\nIsraelis) that they should prostrate to these images out of reverence and they\nshould renew for themselves their allegiance and the mention of their\nmastership and that they should remember the pledge and promise which was taken\nfrom them concerning these two and say \u201cHettah\u201d i.e. say \u2018Verily our prostration\nfor Allah in reverence for the images of Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) and Ali (peace be upon him) and\nour belief in their mastership is a cause for the removal of our sins and\nerasure of misdeeds. Allah the High says \u2018<strong>We will forgive for you\u2019 <\/strong>i.e. with this act<strong> your sins<\/strong>\u2019 of\nthe past and remove your vices of yore \u2018<strong>and soon we shall increase\nfor the good-doers<\/strong>\u2019 whoever among you did not commit\nthe sin committed by those who opposed the mastership and was steadfast on what\nAllah granted him from His side from the covenant of mastership, We will\nincrease their grades and rewards on account of this action. And this is the\nmeaning of the word of Allah \u2013 Mighty and Majestic be He &#8211; \u2018<strong>and soon\nwe shall increase for the good-doers<\/strong>\u2019. The word of\nAllah \u2013 Mighty and Majestic be He \u2013 \u2018<strong>Then the unjust ones changed the\nword to other than what was said to them\u2019<\/strong> i.e. they did\nnot prostrate as they were ordered and they did not utter what they were\ncommanded but they entered it from its front on their backs and instead they\nuttered \u2018red wheat that they clean is dearer to us than this action and this\nword.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, whoever intends to enter the city of the Holy Prophet\n(peace be upon him and his holy progeny), he must enter it through the door ordained by him (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The door of Hettah for Bani Israel was made of wood.

Books of traditions too abound in their libraries. But do they\nfasten unto them? No. Hence, these are not a source of guidance for them. In\nmost of the Muslim cities and countries too, the same applies. They don\u2019t\nfasten unto them. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Extended rope is a metaphorical term used here. It means it\nis the thing to be fastened unto.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will never see any contradiction between the teachings\nof the Holy Quran and the Ahle Bait (peace be upon them) even in a single instance. You will\nsee contradiction between the Holy Quran and the actions or teachings of other\nrulers\/tyrants\/despots but never with the Ahle Bait (peace be upon them) till the Day of\nJudgment. What does this mean? It means that that there is no path other than\nthat of the Holy Quran and the Ahle Bait (peace be upon them). Together they\nform the path of salvation.

Prayers, poor-rate, Hajj,\nfasting and the mastership of us Ahle Bait (peace be upon them). The people acted on four but\ntook the fifth lightly. By Allah! The (first) four will not be completed till\nthey complete them by the fifth.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Allah is the All-Knowing Who knows what is good and what is\nbad for His creatures. He is also the Wise and Just Who puts everything in its\nplace. If something is not fruitful for man, He will not make it obligatory. If\nsomething is not harmful, He will not prohibit it. He is not unjust to anyone\neven for an atom-weight. He is Needless and Self-sufficient. Therefore, when He\norders His servants to establish prayers, He knows that prayers are good and\nbeautiful for His servants. He is not in need of prayers that He ordered them\nfor His benefit. He does not intend to trouble His servants because He is not\nunjust. Thus, everything that He makes obligatory is good and beautiful. When\nthe goodness and beauty of a thing is intense, Allah makes it obligatory. When\nit is not so intense, He makes it recommended. For an obligatory act, there are\nlevels and the same applies for recommended actions as well. When an action is\nneither good nor bad, neither beautiful nor ugly, He simply makes it\npermissible for the servants. When an act is ugly and bad but not extreme in\nits intensity, He makes it abominable and when it is extremely intense in its\nugliness and evil, He makes it prohibited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why Khums is not mentioned in the above tradition? The\nreason is that Khums is an off-shoot of Zakaat. Just as he has not mentioned\nUmrah because Umrah is a supplementary for Hajj. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fifth is the mastership of the Ahle Bait (peace be upon them). It is\nnecessary that people should accept their mastership; they cannot afford to\ndisobey or defy them or bear enmity against them. But the people did not pay\nheed to it. Although, the four without the fifth are incomplete. In other\nwords, Allah will not accept these four without the fifth. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is prayer more important or mastership of Ahle Bait (peace be upon them)? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No doubt, mastership is more important because without it\nprayers will not be accepted. The same applies for the other acts of worship.\nMoreover, it is the Imam (peace be upon him) who guides the people to the more correct way\nof performing all the acts of worship. But this by no means implies that a\nfollower of Ahle Bait (peace be upon them) should take his prayer lightly. For, the Ahle Bait\n(peace be upon him) were an embodiment of divine worship and also exhorted their followers\ntowards prayers saying that their intercession will not reach to those who take\ntheir prayers lightly. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then why has Imam (peace be upon him) placed it after the four acts of worship?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering the understanding and comprehension levels of\nthe people is a very important thing. Otherwise, people will wage a war against\nthe Imam (peace be upon him). For example, there is a tradition in Bukhari, where the Holy\nProphet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) addressed Ayesha as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"ar\">\u064a\u064e\u0627 \u0639\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0634\u064e\u0629\u064f\u060c \u0644\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0644\u0627\u064e \u0642\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0643\u0650 \u062d\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u062b\u064c \u0639\u064e\u0647\u0652\u062f\u064f\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652\u060c\n\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0627\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0632\u064f\u0651\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u0650 \u0628\u0650\u0643\u064f\u0641\u0652\u0631\u064d\u060c \u0644\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0636\u0652\u062a\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629\u064e \u0641\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0644\u0652\u062a\u064f \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0628\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u0650\n\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u064a\u064e\u062f\u0652\u062e\u064f\u0644\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0633\u064f\u060c \u0648\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064c \u064a\u064e\u062e\u0652\u0631\u064f\u062c\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u200f<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cO Aisha! Had not your\npeople been still close to the pre-Islamic period of ignorance (infidelity), I\nwould have dismantled the Ka\u2019bah and would have made two doors in it; one for\nentrance and the other for exit.\u201d (Bukhari, Kitab al-Ilm, Hadis 126)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kabah had two doors since its inception. But the pagans\nshut one door and kept only one door. The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) intended to\nrestore it to its original divine state but he (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) feared that the\npeople would not be able to digest this matter and it would lead to internal\nstrife in the society. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, in the above narration, Imam Sajjad (peace be upon him) has\nkept the most important thing at the end of the duties. For, had he (peace be upon him) kept\nmastership ahead of prayers, some stupid people would have risen against him\nsaying that he has disbelieved and would have gathered to kill him (peace be upon him). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Was it right for Imam Sajjad (peace be upon him) to present Islam in its\ndistorted form (as in the above narration)? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer is NO. Then why he has done it in this narration?\nHe has not presented it in its distorted form; actually, he (peace be upon him) has\npresented it in its actual form.

He (peace be upon him) asked, \u2018<em>Is<\/em> <em>he from those who have\naccepted our mastership?<\/em>\u2019 I replied in the affirmative. He (peace be upon him) said, \u2018<em>His\nmatter is higher than that.<\/em>\u2019 I said, \u2018He is a man who has accepted the\nmastership of Ali but does not know the successors after him.\u2019 (i.e. he does\nnot acknowledge the other Imams (peace be upon them)). He (peace be upon him) retorted, \u2018<em>He is\ndeviated.<\/em>\u2019 I inquired, \u2018What about the one who acknowledges all the Imams\nbut denies one of them?\u2019 He (peace be upon him) answered, \u2018<em>He is like the one who\nacknowledges Eesa (peace be upon him) but denies Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) or acknowledges\nMuhammad (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) but denies Eesa (peace be upon him).

Often, a person knows something but for a specific purpose\nand aim, raises a question so that the point becomes clear for everyone. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The knowers of the unseen are not ordered to use their knowledge\nof the unseen except rarely.

\u2018Surely, the one\nwho believes in Allah with a worship in which he exerts himself but without a\njust Imam from Allah, then his efforts will not be accepted and he is deviated and\nconfused. His example is like that of a sheep which has separated from its\nshepherd and its flock. Whole day it keeps wandering, coming and going, lost.\nWhen night descends, it sees a flock with its shepherd, comes to it and spends\nthe night with it in its pen. When the shepherd drives its flock, it does not\nrecognize its shepherd and its flock and hence, flees in confusion and seeking\nits shepherd and its flock. On departing, it sees another flock of cattle. It\nintends to go towards it and is about to reach it when its shepherd cries, \u2018Go\ntowards your flock. You are lost and confused.&nbsp;\nYou are deviated from your shepherd and your flock\u2019. So, it flees in\npanic and confused. It does not have any shepherd to guide it towards its\npasture or return it. In the meantime, a wolf seizes this opportunity, kills it\nand devours it. O Muhammad! This is exactly the case of the one from this\nnation who does not have a just Imam from Allah. He gets up in the morning, all\nlost and confused. If he dies in this condition, dies the death of disbelief\nand hypocrisy. Know, O Muhammad, the Imams of truth and their followers are\nupon the religion of Allah till its end.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first phrase, \u2018who\nbelieves in Allah\u2019 means that he believes but not the religion sent by Allah. He\nexerts himself implies that like the Kharjiites he worships a lot but since his\nworship is not in the right direction, it is not only not beneficial for him\nbut even harmful. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look at the youth who\ndon\u2019t believe in Islam and religion.

Whoever denies him will die as a Jew or a Christian. By Allah! Allah has not left the earth since Allah \u2013 Mighty and Majestic be He \u2013 caused Adam (peace be upon him) to die except that in it is an Imam through whom people are guided towards Allah as a Proof upon the servants. Whoever abandons him will be destroyed and whoever fastens unto him will be saved. This is binding upon Allah.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, there is one important point. One person is like another. Why should one person obey another? There should definitely be something in the obeyed one which the obeying one does not have. For example, when you have a toothache you go to a dentist. He tells you to open your mouth, you do. Whatever he orders you oblige. Why? He is a specialist in that field. Likewise, in religion, there should be someone who has knowledge from Allah so that his obedience is compulsory. When Allah appoints someone, He orders for his complete and absolute obedience. This appointment should be from the side of Allah. Just as in the case of the dentist, if he does not have a certificate and degree from the Medical Council, how can he practice his trade and why will anyone go to him? Whoever disobeys this divine appointee will die the death of a Jew or a Christian. Here, Jew or Christian are merely examples. It means that he dies the death of an infidel. \u062c\u062d\u0648\u062f means to deny after knowing. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another example: Government builds roads and highways between cities. It also makes some rules and regulations so that there is road discipline and speed on these roads. Whoever follows these rules and discipline will be saved. If somebody does not follow these rules, he will meet with an accident and perish. Both these consequences are logical and rational. Ships and birds also have paths charted out in oceans and air. They don\u2019t sail or fly as they please. If they don\u2019t follow the charted route, they will run into problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Behaar al-Anwaar, vol. 23, p. 85,

\u201cOne day, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) was sitting and with him\nwere a few of his companions, among them was Ali Ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon him). He\n(peace be upon him and his holy progeny) said, \u2018<em>Whoever says there is no god but Allah will enter\nParadise\u2019. <\/em>Two of his companions (apparently referring to the first and the\nsecond rulers) said, \u2018We proclaim that there is no god but Allah\u2019. At this, the\nMessenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) remarked, \u2018<em>The testimony of there is no god\nbut Allah will ONLY be accepted from him and his Shiites those whose covenant\nAllah has taken (in Aalam-e-Zarr).\u2019 <\/em>The two said, \u2018But we believe that\nthere is no god but Allah\u2019. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) placed his hand\non the head of Ali (peace be upon him) and said, \u2018<em>The sign of this is that both of you\ndon\u2019t untie his knot (of allegiance), don\u2019t sit in his place (of caliphate) and\ndon\u2019t deny his word.<\/em>\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Abu Saeed al-Khudri is\nfrom the tribe of Khudrah, an Arabian tribe. He was a venerable companion and\nImam Husain (peace be upon him) has remembered him on the Day of Aashuraa. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, in\ntraditions, when name is not taken in the negative connotation, it is due to\nthe fear for the life of the narrator because this person (the one who is not\nnamed) is highly respected by some and hence, will lead to some problems for\nthe narrator. His followers will try to take revenge from the narrator. Hence,\nhere the two refers to the first and the second rulers. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Untying the knot of\nallegiance which was taken in Ghadeer and other occasions. Don\u2019t usurp his\nposition of caliphate and don\u2019t deny his sayings. But they did all that was\nprohibited and even worse. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Question: This\ntradition proves the Imamate of Ali (peace be upon him) but how does it prove the Imamate of\nthe other Imams (peace be upon them)?&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Answer: Divine texts\namply testify that whatever is applicable for Ali (peace be upon him) is also relevant for\nthe remaining Imams (peace be upon them) from his progeny like obligatory obedience,\nknowledge of the unseen, divine appointment, etc. &nbsp;\u0627\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0651\u0644\u064f\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064c \u0648\u064e \u0627\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0637\u064f\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064c \u0648\u064e \u0622\u062e\u0650\u0631\u064f\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064c \u0648\u064e\n\u0643\u064f\u0644\u064f\u0651\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064c\n(Behaar al-Anwaar, vol. 26, p. 16,\nH. 2). All of them are one light. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apparently, every\ncriminal is a Muslim. Does it make him eligible for paradise? This tahleel\n(saying there is no god but Allah) is not sufficient for a person to go to\nParadise. Umar killed a person for drinking wine. Obviously, that person was a\nMuslim and eligible for Paradise. So why did Umar kill him while he was a man\nfor paradise? Thus, merely this statement for a person to go to Paradise. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imam Reza (peace be upon him)\nduring his journey to Neshaapoor recited the famous narration of the golden\nchain (\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0647\u0628\u064a\u0629) in front of a huge gathering of Sunni scholars.&nbsp; He (peace be upon him) clarified that there are conditions\nfor it and that he (peace be upon him) is one of the conditions. That is, Imamate is one of\nthe conditions for a person to enter Paradise. No learned person \u2013 regardless\nof his sect \u2013 will ever accept that a person like Saddam (may Allah curse him)\nwill go to Paradise just because he has uttered that there is no god but Allah.\nSaddam himself will not accept such a logic otherwise he would not have killed\nso many of his rivals like Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr or waged a war against Iran as\nall of them were reciters of the kalemah. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

al-Hilaali says that a person came\nto Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) and asked, \u201cWhat is the minimum limit by which a\nperson becomes a believer? What is the minimum limit by which a person becomes\na disbeliever? What is the minimum limit by which a person becomes deviated?\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) said, \u201cSince you have asked,\nunderstand the answer. As for the minimum limit by which a person becomes a\nbeliever is that when Allah \u2013 Blessed and High be He \u2013 introduces Himself, he\naccepts Him through obedience, when He introduces His Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny), he\naccepts him through obedience and when He introduces His Imam, His Proof upon\nHis earth and His witness upon His creatures, he should accept him through\nobedience.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked, \u201cO Ameeral Momineen! Even if he is ignorant about\neverything except that what you have described?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be upon him) replied: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. When he is ordered, he should obey and when he is\nrestrained, he must keep away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the minimum limit by which a person becomes a\ndisbeliever is the one who thinks that a thing which Allah has prohibited,\nAllah has ordered it, he makes a religion upon which he prevails and he thinks\nthat he is worshipping the one who has ordered him to do so while (in reality),\nhe is worshipping the Satan. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Note:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In every era, falsehood manifests itself in a very\nsystematic manner. It does not come naked and say I am falsehood so beware of\nme. Thus, in every era, falsehood is camouflaged and presents itself as truth.\nEven in the time of Sulaim it was difficult to decipher despite the presence of\nAmeerul Momineen (peace be upon him) himself.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above tradition, Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) has used the\n59<sup>th<\/sup> verse of Surah Nisaa as an evidence for Imamate. The opponents\ninterpret Ulil Amr as rulers even if he is a transgressor and sinner and\nconsider him as the application of this verse, due to which his obedience\nbecomes absolute like that of Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). When an\nordinary person will not contradict his statement, then how will Allah do it? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Allah the High says in the Holy Quran, \u201c<strong>O\nyou who believe! Fasting has been made obligatory upon you<\/strong>\u201d. But the ruler\nof Tunisia, Habib Burqiba, prohibited fasting for government servants on duty.\nSo, we should obey Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) or Habib Burqiba? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the exception of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) and\nAmeerul Momineen (peace be upon him), all rulers throughout history who formed an apparent\nIslamic government, made laws in violation of the Shariah and were themselves\nnon-infallible, rather transgressors.&nbsp;\nHow can one obey Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) and the transgressor\nruler at the same time? Such a stark contrast is against intellect as well as\nShariah.&nbsp; Therefore, those in authority\nare in reality only those who don\u2019t pass any judgment except in conformity with\nthe judgment of Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him and his holy progeny). So, if we believe that the\nUlil Amr are other than the fourteen infallible guides (peace be upon him), contradiction is\nbound to occur. While, in the Holy Quran, contradiction is impossible.

Sadeq (peace be upon him) informs that the Messenger of Allah\n(peace be upon him and his holy progeny) said, \u201cI am the Chief of the Prophets and my successor is the Chief\nof the successors. My successors are the chiefs of the successors. Surely,\n(Prophet) Adam (peace be upon him) asked Allah \u2013 Mighty and Majestic be He \u2013 that He should\nappoint for him a righteous successor. So Allah \u2013 Mighty and Majestic be He \u2013\nrevealed to him, \u2018Verily, I have honoured the Prophets with Prophethood.\nThereafter, I selected My creatures and made the chosen ones among them as the\nsuccessors. Then Allah said, \u2018O Adam! You appoint Shaith as your successor and\nhe was Hebatullah the son of Adam\u2026.and Yahya Ibn Zakariyya willed to Mundhir,\nwho willed to Sulaimah, who willed to Burdah\u2026Burdah handed it to me (viz. the\nMessenger of Allah s.a.w.a.), and I am handing it to you, O Ali! You should\nhand it to your successor and your successor should hand it over to the\nsuccessors from your progeny, one after the other, till it is handed to the\nbest person of the earth after you. Indeed, the nation will disbelieve on your\naccount and there will be intense disagreements in it regarding you. The one\nwho is steadfast upon you (i.e. your mastership) is like the one who is\nsteadfast with me. The one who disassociates himself from you will be in the\nhell-fire and hell-fire is the abode of the disbelievers.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

on my) duties. I have\ncome to debate with your companions.\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imam Abu Abdillah (peace be upon him)\nasked, \u2018Your theology is from the theology of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny)\nor your own theology?\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He replied, \u2018It is a\ncombination of the theology of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) and my own\ntheology.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imam (peace be upon him) asked, \u2018Are\nyou a partner of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny)?\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He replied, \u2018No.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imam (peace be upon him) inquired, \u2018Do\nyou receive revelation from Allah \u2013 Mighty and Majesty be He \u2013 that informs you\n(of the unseen)?\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again he responded in the\nnegative. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imam (peace be upon him) questioned,\n\u2018Is your obedience obligatory like the obedience of the Messenger of Allah\n(peace be upon him and his holy progeny) was obligatory?\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet again, he said no. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imam Abu Abdillah (peace be upon him)\nturned to me and said, \u2018O Yunus Ibn Yaqoob! He has defeated himself even before\nthe debate has commenced. O Yunus! Had you known to debate well, you would have\ndebated with him.\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I said, \u2018O how much I\nregret (my inability to debate)! May I be held your ransom! I heard you\nprohibiting from debating and saying, \u2018Woe unto the people of theology! They\nsay, \u2018This can be criticized and this cannot be criticized. This can be\nrearranged and this cannot be rearranged. This can be understood and this\ncannot be understood<em>.<\/em>\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imam Abu Abdillah (peace be upon him)\nexplained, \u2018I had said that woe unto them if they forsake what I say and tread\nthe path as per their whim.\u2019 Thereafter, he (peace be upon him) ordered me, \u2018Go to the door\nand whosoever you see of the debaters, bring him in.\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I brought Humraan Ibn\nA\u2019yan, who was a good debater, (Momin al-Taaq) al-Ahwal, who too was a good\ndebater, Heshaam Ibn Saalem, who also was a good debater and Qais al-Maasir,\nwho according to me was the best of them in debates as he had learnt the art of\ndebating from Imam Ali Ibn al-Husain (peace be upon him). We all settled down as a gathering\nand Imam Abu Abdillah (peace be upon him), a few days before the commencement of Hajj, stay\nat the mount near the Holy Ka\u2019bah, in a tent erected for him. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (Yunus) says, \u2018Imam\nAbu Abdillah (peace be upon him) stuck out his head from his tent, when he (peace be upon him) saw a camel\nambling. He (peace be upon him) exclaimed, \u2018<em>Heshaam! By the Lord of the Ka\u2019bah!<\/em>\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We thought it was\nHeshaam, a man from the progeny of Aqeel (Ibn Abi Talib), whom Imam (peace be upon him)\nloved a lot. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heshaam Ibn al-Hakam, who\nwas so young that his beard had just started to grow, entered. He was the\nyoungest of us. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imam Abu Abdillah (peace be upon him)\nmade place for him and said, \u2018(He is) our helper with his heart, his tongue and\nhis hands.\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thereafter, Imam (peace be upon him)\nordered, \u2018<em>O Humraan! Debate with him (i.e. the Syrian).<\/em>\u2019 Humraan debated\nwith him and defeated him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imam (peace be upon him) said, \u2018<em>O\nTaaqi!

My Lord is more considerate towards His creatures than the creatures\nare towards themselves.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heshaam: \u2018What did He do\nto show His care towards His creatures?\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syrian: \u2018He established a\nproof and a guide for them so that they may not disperse or when they disagree,\nhe (the guide) unites them, straightens their crookedness and informs them of\ntheir duties towards their Lord.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heshaam: \u2018Who is this proof\nand guide?\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syrian: \u2018The Messenger of\nAllah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny).\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heshaam: And who after\nthe Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny)?&#8217;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syrian: The Book and the\nSunnah<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heshaam: Are the Book and\nthe Sunnah beneficial for us today in removing our differneces? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syrian: Yes<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heshaam: Then why are we,\nyou and me, disagreeing and you have come all the way from Syria, in our\ndispute with you? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syrian was silent. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imam Abu Abdillah (peace be upon him)\nasked the Syrian, \u2018<em>Why are you not talking<\/em>?\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Syrian responded, \u2018If\nI say we don\u2019t disagree, I will be lying. If I say the Book and the Sunnah\ndispels our disagreements, I will nullify my own argument because each of them\nhas several intepretations. If I say we disagree and both of us claim to be\nright, then the Book and the Sunnah do not benefit us but that there should be\nan argument in it in my favour against him.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imam Abu Abdillah (peace be upon him)\ntold him, \u2018Ask him (viz. Heshaam). You will find him for a long time (a handful\nin answering you).\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syrian: O so and so! Who\nis more caring towards the creatures? Their Lord or they themselves?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heshaam: Their Lord is\nmore caring towards them than they are to themselves. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syrian: So, has He\nappointed for them someone who will gather their words, straighten their\ncrookedness and informs them of their right from their wrong? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heshaam: During the time\nof the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) or now? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syrian: In the time of\nthe Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny), it was the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny)\nhimself. But who is the divine proof today?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heshaam: The one who is\nsitting here, to whom people set out and he informs us about the news of the\nskies and the earth, inheriting it from his father and grandfather. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syrian: How can this be\nproved for me? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heshaam: Ask him whatever\nyou want. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syrian: You have severed\nmy excuses. I have no option but to ask. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imam Abu Abdillah (peace be upon him)\ninformed, \u2018O Syrian! I will inform you about your journey and the details of\nyour path. It was such and such.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Syrian said, \u2018You\nhave spoken the truth. I submit to Allah right now.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imam Abu Abdillah (peace be upon him)\nrectified him, \u2018Rather say, I believe in Allah right now. Islam is before\nImaan. Inheritance and marriage is based on Islam while reward (in the\nhereafter) is based on Imaan.\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Syrian accepted, \u2018You\nhave spoken the truth. Right now I testify that there is no god but Allah, that\nMuhammad is the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) and that you are the successor of\nthe successors\u2026.\u2019

From them\nwere Humraan Ibn A\u2019yan, Muhammad Ibn al-No\u2019maan, Heshaam Ibn Saalem, al-Tayyaar\nand a group from whom was a young man Heshaam Ibn al-Hakam. Imam al-Sadeq\n(peace be upon him) told him, \u2018<em>O Heshaam! Will you not inform me how you dealt with Amr\nIbn Obaid and how you questioned him?<\/em>\u2019 Heshaam replied, \u2018O son of Allah\u2019s\nMessenger! I hold you in awe, feel shy in front of you and become tongue-tied.\u2019\nImam (peace be upon him) retorted, \u2018<em>When I order you something, then do it.<\/em>\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heshaam said, \u2018I heard about the beliefs of Amr Ibn Obaid\nand his gatherings in the Mosque of Basrah. It was difficult for me to bear\nthis. Hence, I set out for him and reached Basrah on Friday. I came to the\nMosque of Basrah and saw a huge circle in which was Amr Ibn Obaid, donning\nblack cloak\nof wool and another robe over it. People were asking him questions. I made my\nway through the people and sat at the end of the circle on my knees. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thereafter, I asked him, \u2018O learned man! I am a stranger. If you permit,\ncan I ask something?\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He told me, \u2018Yes\u2019. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I questioned him, \u2018Do you have eyes?\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He shot back,\u2019O son!

When the limbs doubt about anything that they smell,\nsee, taste or hear, they refer it to the intellect, seeking certainty and\ndispelling the doubt.\u2019&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I took confirmation, \u2018It means the presence of the intellect is\nnecessary otherwise the limbs cannot gain certainty.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He reaffirmed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reasoned, \u2018O Aba Marwan! So Allah has not left your limbs without a\nleader who will verify for them the correct things and grant certainty to them\nin things they doubt. But has left this entire creation in their perplexity,\ndoubt and disagreements, without appointing a leader for them to whom they can\nrefer in their doubts and confusions, yet He has left a leader for you for your\nlimbs to whom you can refer in your confusions and doubts.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He kept silent and did not say anything to me. Thereafter, he turned to\nme and asked, \u2018Are you Heshaam Ibn al-Hakam?\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Praciticing dissimulation) I denied.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He questioned again, \u2018Are you from his colleauges?\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, I refuted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He asked, \u2018From where are you?\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I replied, \u2018I am a resident of Kufa.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said, \u2018Then you are certaintly him (viz. Heshaam).\u2019 Saying this, he\nembraced me, made me sit in his seat and moved away from it. He did not utter a\nword till I stood up. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Hearing this incident), Imam Sadeq (peace be upon him) laughed and asked, \u2018<em>O\nHeshaam! Who taught you this?<\/em>\u2019&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He answered, \u2018This is what I have learnt from you and compiled.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He (peace be upon him) remarked, \u2018By Allah!

him a hundred thousand good deeds, remove\nfrom him a hundred thousand sins and raise him a hundred thousand degrees.\nMoreover, it is as if he has freed a hundred thousand slaves and Allah &#8211;

He (peace be upon him)\nreplied, <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018By Allah! It refers to the\nfollowers of so and so (referring to the first and second pseudo-caliphs). They\ntook them as leaders other than the Imam whom Allah has appointed as an Imam\nfor the people. Therefore, He says<strong>, \u2018and O, that those who are unjust had\nseen, when they see the chastisement, that the power is wholly Allah\u2019s and that\nAllah is severe in requiting (evil). When those who were followed shall\nrenounce those who followed (them), and they see the chastisement and their\nties are cut asunder. And those who followed shall say: Had there been for us a\nreturn, then we would renounce them as they have renounced us. Thus will Allah\nshow them their deeds to be intense regret to them, and they shall not come\nforth from the fire.\u2019<\/strong> (Surah Baqarah (2): Verses 165 -167) <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thereafter, Imam Abu Ja\u2019far\n(a.s) remarked, <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018O Jaabir!

I\nfind people who do not consider you (Ahl al-Bayt) as their guardians and\nInfallible Imams (Leaders with Divine Authority) but they consider so and so as\ntheir Imam. However, they are trustworthy, truthful and loyal. I also find\npeople who consider you as their guardians and Infallible Imams (Leaders with\nDivine Authority) but are not trustworthy, loyal and truthful.\u2019 Abu Abd Allah\n(peace be upon him) then sat in an upright position and turned to me as if angered, and then\nsaid, \u2018One who follows the religion of Allah under the\nguardianship of an unjust Imam who does not possesses Divine Authority, has no\nreligion. One who follows the religion of Allah under the guardianship of an\nImam who is just in his dealings and possesses Divine Authority, will suffer no\nnegative effect.\u2019 \u201cI then asked, \u2018Do those, in fact, have no religion,\nand these face no destruction?\u2019 The Imam (peace be upon him) said, \u2018That\nis correct. Those have no religion and these face no destruction.\u2019 Then\nthe Imam (peace be upon him) said, \u2018Have you not heard the words of\nAllah, the Most Majestic, the Most Gracious: \u2018Allah is\nthe Guardian of the believers and it is He who takes them out of darkness into\nlight\u2026\u2019 (2:257) It means that He takes them out of\nthe darkness of sins to the light of repentance and forgiveness because of\ntheir love for and their being under the guardianship of the just Infallible\nImams (peace be upon them) who possess Divine Authority. He has also said, \u2018The Devil is the guardian of those who deny the Truth and he leads\nthem from light to darkness\u2026\u2019 (2:257) It means that\nthey were in the light of Islam but when they accepted the guardianship and the\nleadership of every unjust Imam who possessed no authority from Allah, the Most\nMajestic, the Most Gracious, their guardianship took them out of the light of\nIslam to the darkness of disbelief.

truthful\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>He (peace be upon him) exclaimed, \u201cGlory be to Allah! They have distorted everything to such an extent, have they distorted even this?\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I said, \u2018Yes\u2019.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>He (peace be upon him) said, \u201cSurely Allah Mighty and Majestic be He when He created the Arsh, He wrote upon it, \u201cThere is no god but Allah, Mohammad is the Prophet of Allah, Ali is the Chief of the Believers\u201d.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When Allah created Israafeel, He wrote on his forehead, \u201cThere is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Prophet of Allah, Ali is the Chief of the

Then, he told me, \u2018Verily, Allah loves Hasan\u2019 so I prostrated and raised my head. Then, he told me, \u2018Verily, Allah loves Husain\u2019 so I prostrated and raised my head. Then, he told me, \u2018Verily Allah loves those who love them, so I prostrated and raised my head\u2019.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2

Ali (peace be upon him) entrusted it to an engraver who inscribed the desired words.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The next day when Ali (peace be upon him) took back that ring from the engraver he saw that the words \u2018Muhammad Rasoolullaah\u2019 were engraved on it. Ali (peace be upon him) said: \u201cI did not tell you to engrave these words.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>He replied: \u201cO Ali! You are right. I made a mistake.

The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) wore it and said: \u201cI am both Muhammad bin Abdullah and Muhammad Rasoolullaah.\u201d Next morning when it was seen, the words \u2018Aliyun Waliyullah\u2019 were also found written thereon. It astonished the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny).<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Jibraeel (peace be upon him) came and said that the Almighty Allah says: \u201cMy beloved!

zakat, performs hajj and umrah but does not recognize the one whose obedience has been made compulsory on himthen its like he never prayed and neither gave zakat or performed hajj and umrah. He did not take ceremonial bath of janabat or purified himself. He had no clue what is haraam or halaal as if he never observed them. His namaaz can never be namaaz despite his multiple ruku and sujud. For him it\u2019s no zakat and hajj as well. All these actions from him will only take shape after he acquires recognition of the one whose obedience is made compulsory by Allah and did a huge favour to them.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2

\u201cI asked Imam Abu Muhammad (al-Askari a.s.) about the word of Allah, \u2018Then we gave in inheritance the Book to those whom We chose from Our servants. So from them is the one who is unjust to himself and from them is the moderate one and from them is the one who is foremost in good deeds with the permission of Allah\u2019 (Surah Faatir (35): Verse 32). He (peace be upon him) replied,<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u2018All of them belong to the progeny of Muhammad. The one who is unjust to himself is the one who does not acknowledge the Imam\u2019. On hearing this, I started crying and I started thinking about the greatness of the bounty that is given to the progeny of Muhammad (salutations be on Muhammad and his progeny). So, Abu Muhammad (peace be upon him) looked at me and said, \u2018The reality of the affair is even greater than what you think about the great position of Muhammad\u2019s progeny. Then, praise Allah for indeed, you have been made to fasten unto their rope; you will be called on the Day of Judgment with them when all other people <strong>will be called with their Imams<\/strong>. So, receive glad tidings O Aba Hashim because surely you are on goodness.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References:<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Kashful Ghummah, vol. 2, p. 419<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Madinatul Ma\u2019ajiz, vol. 7, p. 635, H. 2619<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Behaar al-Anwaar, vol. 23, p. 218, H. 18<\/p>\r\n<p>4. \u00a0\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thestrongrope.com\/fragrance-of-mastership\/\">Fragrance of Mastership<\/a> H. 6<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u062f\u064e\u0627\u0648\u064f\u062f\u064e \u0628\u0652\u0646\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0633\u0650\u0645\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062c\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0650\u0651 \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e: \u0633\u064e\u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u062a\u064f \u0627\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064d \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0642\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0644\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u0650\u200f \u062b\u064f\u0645\u064e\u0651 \u0627\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0631\u064e\u062b\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0643\u0650\u062a\u0627\u0628\u064e \u0627\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0635\u0652\u0637\u064e\u0641\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0639\u0650\u0628\u0627\u062f\u0650\u0646\u0627 \u0641\u064e\u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0638\u0627\u0644\u0650\u0645\u064c \u0644\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0633\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u064e \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0645\u064f\u0642\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0635\u0650\u062f\u064c \u0648\u064e \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0633\u0627\u0628\u0650\u0642\u064c \u0628\u0650\u0627\u0644\u0652\u062e\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u0627\u062a\u0650 \u0628\u0650\u0627\u0650\u0630\u0652\u0646\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u0650\u200f \u0641\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0643\u064f\u0644\u064f\u0651\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0622\u0644\u0650 \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064d \u0627\u0644\u0638\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0644\u0650\u0645\u064f \u0644\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0633\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0630\u0650\u064a \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064f\u0642\u0650\u0631\u064f\u0651 \u0628\u0650\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0627\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0645\u0650 \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0641\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0639\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0639\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u0650\u064a \u0648\u064e \u062c\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0644\u0652\u062a\u064f \u0623\u064f\u0641\u064e\u0643\u0650\u0651\u0631\u064f \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0646\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0633\u0650\u064a \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0639\u0650\u0638\u064e\u0645\u0650 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0623\u064f\u0639\u0652\u0637\u0650\u064a\u064e \u0622\u0644\u064f \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064d&#8230;

(peace be upon him) says that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) declared, \u201cVerily the traditions of Aale Muhammad (peace be upon him) are difficult and complex. None will believe in them except a proximate angel or a sent messenger or a servant whose heart has been tested by Allah for faith. So whenever a hadees from Aale Muhammad (peace be upon him) comes to you towards which your hearts are inclined and you are cognizant of it, accept it. But if your hearts tremble on hearing it and you dislike it, refer it to Allah, the Messenger and the Knowledgeable from the Aale Muhammad (peace be upon him). Verily, he is destroyed who on hearing such a hadees cannot bear it and says, \u2018By Allah! This is not the truth, By Allah! This is not the truth.\u2019 Denying is disbelief.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References:<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Al-Kaafi, vol. 1, p. 401, H.
